## Installation

I'm using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) as my static site generator to showcase all the resources in this repo.

To get this up and running locally, type in the following commands.

```bash
# It is recommended to install docsify-cli globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

npm i docsify-cli -g

# Run the local server with docsify serve. You can preview the site in your browser on http://localhost:3000.

docsify serve docs
```
