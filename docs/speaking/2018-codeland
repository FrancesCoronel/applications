Story
Please describe the beginning, middle, and end of the talk. This should be a completed outline of what you will present. For example, instead of saying “this talk will provide 3 best practices for learning to code on your own,” your outline should list out what those three best practices are along with as much detail on each one as possible to give us a clear idea of what your talk will look like.
Your answer

Problem *
What is the problem your talk addresses? Why is this problem important or interesting to our attendees?

How do you want the audience to feel when you’re done?

Research *
While personal stories are powerful, we highly encourage you to research your subject and use data/resources whenever possible. What resources and research do you plan to include in your talk, if any? (interviews, reports, primary sources, academic journals, etc.)
