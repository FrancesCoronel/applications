# Codeland - Panelist

## Prior Speaking Experience

I've spoken at various conferences, Meetups, and related tech events since 2015. My first ever conference talk was on "Web Design for Developers" and since then I've spoken on topics such as "JS Coding Bootcamps", "So You Want To Be A Wizard", "My Experience with Fullstack Academy", "Why should you pursue a career in coding?", the ACM organization, and the Hour of Code.

An overview of all these talks along with pictures can be found on my website (https://fvcproductions.com/home/services/speaking/). All presentations can be found on my Speaker Deck (https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions) or SlideShare (http://www.slideshare.net/FVCproductions). More conference activity can be found on my Lanyrd (http://lanyrd.com/profile/fvcproductions/).

My personal favorites are "So You Want To Be a Wizard" (https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard-free-code-camp-norfolk) and "Web Design for Developers" (https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/web-design-innovation-hackathon).

Portfolio (creating an effective coding portfolio)

## 3 Talking Points

> What three points would you like to make as a panelist on this topic? Please provide as much detail as possible.


1. Marketing: When you're applying to jobs, you're selling yourself. You are marketing yourself. And marketing is essentially about making sure you showcase everything you've done. Let's say you volunteer to tutor kids in basic computer science fundamentals. You don't share this information with anyone but your mom. That means employers don't know, your friends studying CS with you don't know, and essentially nobody but your mom knows you took the initiative and spent your free time tutoring kids in CS. Ergo, it's important to understand that anything you do related to the tech industry can be utilized and showcased as an example of your passion and expertise.

2. Choosing: Getting an initial portfolio website out there is not difficult anymore. Or expensive. There are so many great options (GitHub Pages, Wordpress, Squarespace, Weebly, etc.). You just need to choose the one you love the most.

3. Scalability: Depending on how much you get involved in, your portfolio will either start to stay simple or become very complex. Scalability is an aspect that has to be considered early on. Let's say you have your website and it showcases two projects. What about after you've done 20? Will that same website still work? Should you just outsource to another website? Front end designers and developers both have this problem a lot since they want to maintain a personal portfolio where they showcase their work but often also feel obligated to publish their work on a 3rd party platform and they end up feeling like they have to publish the same content on 5 different websites.

## Intention

Like they've just got to go out there and create their first personal website and start sharing to the world how much drive they have to getting into the tech industry.

## Fit

> Why are you the right person to be on this panel? This is less about expertise (which is not a requirement), and more about the relationship between the topic and the panelist, and finding a good fit. Feel free to include your passion, past experience, previous roles, etc.


I've maintained a personal portfolio since 2013 and know the various kinks one has to deal with. Given that I consider myself both a designer and developer, I've had to deal with various aspects such as outsourcing content to different sites, scalability, and choosing which platform to go with initially. I am an avid online user and portfolio maintainer and this can be more evidently seen through my Gravatar (http://gravatar.com/fvcproductions) which serves as a personal blueprint of sorts.
