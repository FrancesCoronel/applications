## What is a professional challenge that you are currently working on? (150 words or less)

Something I've been working on improving is staying calm and positive in high stakes situations at work.

In today's fast-moving world, we are constantly under pressure to act NOW, rather than spend time reasoning things through and thinking about the true facts. Not only can this mindset lead me to a wrong conclusion when I don't have enough time to digest my thoughts, but it can also cause conflict with other people who draw different conclusions.

A tool I've used to help with this has been the "Ladder of Inference" which describes the perception starting from senses to the series of mental steps that need to be taken to work towards an action.

This mental strategy of walking down the ladder has kept me calmer under high-pressure situations at work where I need to act quickly but without having things spiral out of control.

## What is a professional accomplishment that you're most proud of? (150 words or less)

My proudest accomplishment has been dedicating myself to what I'm passionate about outside of work - such as elevating Latinx in Tech and sharing my technical insights and personal story with others.

As a board member and open source lead for the nonprofit Techqueria, I help strategize for one of the largest communities for Latinx in Tech. With my help, Techqueria recently won a \$10K grant to create an open source member portal for our community and I'm excited to continue scaling our efforts to not just bring more Latinx into the tech industry but have them thriving.

Since 2015, I've also had the opportunity to speak at over 40 different events on topics such as Progressive Web Apps, TypeScript, Open Source, Web Design, my career path in tech and being a Latina software engineer.

## Why do you want to participate in the LTX Level Up program?

The Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations. And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Black and Latinx women holding only 3% and 1% of these jobs, respectively.

So what can one conclude from all this?

Well, first, let me provide some context.

A unicorn is a startup company (like Slack) valued at over \$1 billion. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about 1.28% likely to happen).

This means that according to those standards, I'm quite literally a "unicorn" in the sense that I'm part of the 1% of Latinas that considers herself a die-hard software engineer.

Now I became aware of this isolation so long ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who want to enter the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in.

However, I have no desire for the situation to remain this way as my existence in tech shouldn’t have to be this rare and magical event.

Instead, I’d like to band together with other unicorns so that we can lead, influence and inspire the next generation of minority women to not just break into but also prosper in tech.

Together, I believe we can transform ourselves from these mythical creatures to the more common but magnificent stallions.

To truly break down this stereotype, we need to have more Latinas pursuing careers in tech where so much power and wealth lies but is not divided fairly.

With this program, I'm hoping to not only learn how to become a better leader, but ultimately, my goal lies in getting to the point where I can inspire others on a massive scale and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead in the tech industry. In any industry, really.

I also hope this program will set me up to become a leader and I would like to work on driving change without explicit authority and from a place of sympathy. If I want to seek a leadership role at a tech company in the future, I need to work on asserting myself better and communicating more effectively to large audiences.

## I'd be most disappointed if, after the LTX Level Up experience, I felt like I did NOT get...

- [ ] A feeling of camaraderie and fellowship with the other members of the cohort
- [ ] A personal, ongoing relationship with at least one other member of the cohort
- [x] A relevant, new leadership skill to practice at work
- [ ] Access to great, unique content

## What benefits of the program are you most excited about? (check all that apply)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- [ ] $5,000 Stipend
- [ ] An all-paid for 2 day activation experience to meet your fellow leaders
- [x] Tailored executive coaching and mentorship for 6 months
- [ ] All expenses paid, VIP ticket to the LTX Summit in October

## Professional Narrative

Hello, I’m Frances and I’m a unicorn that engineers solutions on behalf of another unicorn.

Let me break that down.

The term “unicorn” was coined in the tech industry because researchers found that the statistical likelihood of a tech startup becoming valued at 1 billion dollars or more is about 1%.

And it just so happens that the Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that only 1% of women in tech identify as Latina.

So now you can see how one can be a unicorn or a Latina software engineer such as myself and can work for another unicorn like the enterprise startup Slack - which is currently worth well over 1 billion dollars.

However, I have no desire for the situation to remain this way as my existence in tech shouldn’t have to be this rare and magical event.

Instead, I’d like to band together with other unicorns so that we can lead, influence and inspire the next generation of minority women to not just break into but also prosper.

Together, I believe we can transform ourselves from these mythical creatures to the more common but magnificent stallions.
