In terms of prior speaking experience, I've given technical talks over 35 times so far on web design, coding bootcamps, TypeScript and how to get started in the tech field. I've given these talks not just at conferences but at hackathons and Meetups as well.

You can see the full list of my prior and upcoming speaking engagements on my website at https://fvcproductions.com/speaking/.

## Title

Progressive Web Apps: websites that took all the right vitamins

## Abstract

This talk walks you through the steps of transforming an existing website into a Progressive Web App from the bottom up.

Together we’ll also explore the vast array of companies that have already benefited from the many enhancements PWAs offer and why they’re so successful in emerging markets.

## Reviews

### Review 1

> Overall Thoughts

Progressive Web Apps has, indeed been picking up among web developers and business who want to benefit from fast and reliable website technologies. The proposal offers to present on this topic that might be appealing to many among the participants at GHC. The speaker seems to have experience on the topic and provides relevant specifics, as well as specific outcomes that are aimed from the presentation. The organization of the proposal, however, seems a little abrupt and disorganized. It seems like the author treated the write up of the proposal as if it was the presentation that they hope to deliver. The distinction between a written proposal and the presentation could have been refined to improve the quality of the proposal.

> What Worked Well

Specific details of progressive web apps and how the presenter is planning to approach it was useful to get a better sense of the structure of the presentation that the author is planning to deliver.

> Areas of Improvement

The write of the official proposal could have been refined. As it is written, it sounds like scripts taken out of other speeches that the presenter delivered elsewhere on the same topic. In the introduction section of the proposal, the author switches between the third person to the first person which is usually not a good idea in writing bios. The proposal could have been a little bit more detailed to name at least a few of the PWA technologies, their uses, the current state of them, future expectations etc. to better structure the proposal.

## Review 2

> Overall Thoughts

This proposal gives a general introduction about how to transform an existing website into a Progressive Web App.

> What Worked Well

The proposal describe a new concept (PWAs) and explained why it's needed in the context of regular websites, and mobile apps, etc.

> Areas of Improvement

The content of the proposal proposal does not have enough details on what unique information the user will be able to deliver.
With the author's bio, it'll be useful if the author can combine her experience with PWA to showcase what unique knowledge she can share to the audience.

## Review 3

> Overall Thoughts

There has been a lot of development on the Progressive Web Apps front as more and more companies are adopting this new technology. Given that the usage of handheld devices has gone up significantly and user experience is the key factor, PWA will likely change the future of web development. The proposal assumes intermediate level audience with prior knowledge of web development which is going to draw a good mix of audience from both professional field and academics. It would be useful to know your plan on how you will explain the conversion of existing website to PWAs. Are there tools available to do this conversion? What does the conversion process typically look like?

> What Worked Well

I like the fact that you've not only explained the new technology but have also identified it as a next career opportunity for developers who have experience with website building or who are passionate about creating amazing user experience on web. This will be a great topic for the GraceHopper conference with a wide range of attendees from industry and academics. Also with focus on edge computing these PWAs will be more and more relevant in delivering user experience with speed and reliability.

> Areas of Improvement

I wonder if this would be better suited for a workshop? Normally for topics related to tools and programming languages (in this case javascript, html, CSS) users can grasp better when there is hands-on exercise involved. Other suggestion would be outline a plan on how you will carry out the presentation, As of now it looks the talk will cover high-level understanding of the PWA concepts needed to convert an existing website to PWA. Some diagrams or pictures of how a PWA design looks like would have been helpful too.
