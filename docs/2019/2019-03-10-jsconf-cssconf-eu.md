# JSConf/CSSconf EU

## What is your motivation to attend JSConf EU and/or CSSconf EU? What goals do you have in attending?

Well, as a budding software engineer focused on UI development, JSConf/CSSConf directly addresses the tools and topics I want to develop my skills in. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skill set whenever necessary - i.e. back in 2015, I was all about the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack and nowadays everyone is using React based tech stacks.

Some folks would get bothered by the constant change but it's honestly what I love most about the work I do and I actually think it's great how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time. Through the power of JavaScript, I want to be able to explore how I can make my web apps both in my workplace and through my open-source contributions scale even better. I believe such a feat would really set on my right path to a great start to what I hope will be a long career in the tech industry. I'm a HUGE fan of JavaScript - I've given various talks related to JavaScript and its super set TypeScript at conferences, Meetups & hackathons: https://www.fvcproductions.com/speaking/

Attending JSConf/CSSconf would also positively contribute to my career at Slack since we're very focused on improving the reliability and performance of our clients and marketing websites. Being exposed to expert level talks like "Hello subgrid!" by Rachel Andrew and "Performance Empathy" by Houssein Djirdeh are both extremely relevant for my day to day job in maintaining and extending Slack.com as an engineer on the customer acquisition team.

## If you don't mind, tell us a little bit about yourself. Please do not mention any personal identifying info here, e.g. twitter handle, name, etc.

I’m a unicorn that engineers solutions on behalf of another unicorn.

That might sound a bit confusing so let me break that down.

The term “unicorn” was coined in the tech industry because researchers found that the statistical likelihood of a tech startup becoming valued at 1 billion dollars or more is about 1%.

And it just so happens that the Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that only 1% of women in tech identify as Latina.

So now you can see how one can be a unicorn or a Latina software engineer such as myself and can work for another unicorn like the enterprise startup Slack - which is currently worth well over 1 billion dollars.

However, I have no desire for the situation to remain this way as my existence in tech shouldn’t have to be this rare and magical event.

Instead, I’d like to band together with other unicorns so that we can lead, influence and inspire the next generation of minority women to not just break into but also prosper.

Together, I believe we can transform ourselves from these mythical creatures to the more common but magnificent stallions.
