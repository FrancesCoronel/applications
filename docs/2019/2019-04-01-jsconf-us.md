# JSConf

## Why do you want to attend JSConf US?

Well, as a budding software engineer focused on UI development, JSConf directly addresses the tools and topics I want to develop my skills in. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skill set whenever necessary - i.e. back in 2015, I was all about the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack and nowadays everyone is using React based tech stacks.

Some folks would get bothered by the constant change but it's honestly what I love most about the work I do and I actually think it's great how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time. Through the power of JavaScript, I want to be able to explore how I can make my web apps both in my workplace and through my open-source contributions scale even better. I believe such a feat would really set on my right path to a great start to what I hope will be a long career in the tech industry.

I'm also just a HUGE fan - I've given various talks related to JavaScript and its super set TypeScript at conferences, Meetups & hackathons: https://www.fvcproductions.com/speaking/

Attending JSConf would also positively contribute to my career at Slack since we're very focused on improving the reliability and performance of our clients and marketing websites. Being exposed to the kind of talks given at JSConf would be extremely relevant for my day to day job in maintaining and improving Slack.com as an engineer on the customer acquisition team.
