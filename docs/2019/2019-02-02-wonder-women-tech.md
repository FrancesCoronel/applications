## Does the Speaker have a background in Tech, STEAM and/or Innovation? How so?

> Please share in detail the level of expertise and experience in the tech and STEAM industry.

Yes, I have a Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science along with a nearly 5 years of experience under my belt as I have been coding professionally since 2015. I currently work at Slack, one of the fastest growing enterprise startups in history, as a software engineer on the Customer Acquisition team.

## Why is the Speaker passionate about seeing more women and diversity in tech?

> Share any experience with spearheading initiatives that contribute to increasing visibility for women and diversity in tech.

As a double minority or Latina in Tech with a lot of professional and speaking experience, I recognize my unique standing in the tech industry. This is why I tend to gravitate toward organizations that serve underrepresented individuals such as myself.

As such, I'm the open source lead with Techqueria, one of the largest Latinx in tech organizations and I also volunteer with non-profit organizations that specialize in improving access to the tech industry for those in underrepresented backgrounds (Code2040, The Last Mile, SMASH Academy, Girl Develop It, Out of Office Hours, TechHire Oakland, Code.org, etc).

You can see a full laundry list of organizations I've been involved with on my website:

> Please provide detailed info on offer and product/service quantity.

Yes, I can provide stickers and swag from Slack. I would raffle the socks and stickers could be provided for all attendees.

## What is the Speaker's Sphere of Influence?

> This would include Social Media numbers and Mailing List, etc. Please include Social Media links. All speakers will be asked to share conference details with their network.

## Why should we choose this Speaker for Wonder Women Tech 2018-2019?

> This is a chance to shine! Highlight all the areas that may be of value to our conference.

I've spoken at 35 events already so I have plenty of tangible speaking experience and I'm also extremely rare.

What do I mean by rare?

So I’m actually a unicorn that engineers solutions on behalf of another unicorn.

Let me break that down.

The term “unicorn” was coined in the tech industry because researchers found that the statistical likelihood of a tech startup becoming valued at 1 billion dollars or more is about 1%.

And it just so happens that the Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that only 1% of women in tech identify as Latina.

So now you can see how one can be a unicorn or a Latina software engineer such as myself and can work for another unicorn like the enterprise startup Slack - which is worth more than 7 billion dollars.

However, I have no desire for the situation to remain this way as my existence in tech shouldn’t have to be this rare and magical event.

Instead, I’d like to band together with other unicorns so that we can lead, influence and inspire the next generation of minority women to not just break into but also prosper.

Together, I believe we can transform ourselves from these mythical creatures to the more common but magnificent stallions.
