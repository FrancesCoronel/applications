# Is there a particular technology or industry you're currently interested in? How come? Where do you see it heading in the future?

Yes, I think coding bootcamps are going to be seen as a viable way of getting a job in the tech industry versus the standard getting a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from a university.

Programs like Coursera and Udacity have already provided a lot of free premier educational resources for those who cannot afford a traditional degree and I find them quite beneficial but the completion rates for online courses can’t be ignored and I’ve experienced personally how difficult it can be to become disciplined enough to learn on your own unless it is highly interactive. I believe it is part of the reason coding bootcamps are doing so well financially since they’re able to charge for that in-person classroom like setting. I don’t like saying the word classroom because it has such a negative connotation in my mindset but regardless, a lot of folks see coding bootcamps as the more viable option in terms of time, commitment, and money. And a lot of the time, it is.

So all in all, I believe coding bootcamps in the future will either find themselves being incorporated into the CS curriculum by top schools who can afford it (which is already happening) or transforming into another trusted avenue of getting a job in the tech industry.
