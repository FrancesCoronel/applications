## Product Studio - NYTimes

Every fall, leading startups, companies, and organizations in NYC pose business challenges to Cornell Tech. In Product Studio, teams develop and present new products, services, and strategies that respond to those challenges. My team responded to The New York Times Community challenge: How might we create a safe place for people of all backgrounds to discuss important local, national, and global issues?

To address this problem, we created Q&A, a platform that solicits the opinion of readers based off of both the text analysis of an article and their personal reading history. Feel free to view the final result here: "https://fvcproductions.com/portfolio/product-studio-final-sprint/".

This is a project I'm especially proud of because I was able to have a lot of decision control over the end product as the lead developer and designer on the team. I also felt I could actually relate to my product since it was trying to solve the issue of diversifying communities, which is something I personally struggle with myself.

## Jeopardy Template

My mom is a Spanish high school teacher and she was frustrated trying to create a Jeopardy template using PPT. I told her I would make her one and as a result I created a version for not just Google Slides (which is much nicer than PPT in my opinion) but also a version for Keynote. I published it last year and so far it’s gotten almost 20K hits across the web just based off my Behance, Speaker Deck, and bit.ly link stats I made for them. Over 200 people have reached out via Google Slides attempting to get edit access (I have the emails to prove this). It got to the point where I had to set up an automatic reply for anyone trying to do this in order to show them how to make a copy that they could edit themselves on Google Slides.

## Alienware Desktop

This is a customization I made for my Mac two years ago back when it was easier to customize such things. Even though I’ve never used an Alienware computer, I think their design is really cool so I based it off that. I chose this project not because its technically challenging but because the concept of customization in general is very appealing to me and I apply to a lot of aspects in my life. In other words, I have always have believed customized, tailored solutions are much cooler and what I generally find more enjoyable in whatever environment I’m working in.

## MapMe Coding Bootcamps

I don't know if this would necessarily be deemed technical but I did help create a map of all the coding bootcamps out there because I didn't see any existing solution in place. I myself have attended It's gotten over 16K hits on Google Maps alone but I recently created a crowd-sourced version as well. Either way, both of these are the two top results on Google for the search query "map of coding bootcamps".
