# Describe something you do for your community or the benefit of others. What inspires you to do this?

I mentor, freelance, and speak with organizations that promote diversity in tech.

Some recent examples of this are:

- acted as a graduate mentor for WiTNY (Women in Technology & Entrepreneurship in New York) through Cornell Tech
- freelance blogging for AlterConf which is a traveling conference promoting diversity in tech
- spoke at a Fullstack Academy alumni panel which is a coding bootcamp that helped created Grace Hopper Academy - one of the few all female coding bootcamps that doesn't charge any tuition up front

I am one of the few Latinas I know studying computer science (usually the only one in the room) and because I realized the severity of my isolation so long ago, I've had a strong desire from the beginning to inspire those who want to come into the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in. Ultimately, the impact I want to have on the world lies in becoming a leader in the tech industry in order to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.
