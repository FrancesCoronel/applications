# When you're not coding, what do you like to do?

Attend Meetups, obsess over the latest and greatest productivity/coding tools (via Product Hunt mostly), question Quora, watch John Oliver on YouTube, discover a song on Spotify and repeat it over and over till I get sick of it, blog/write/read, attend/speak at/freelance at tech conferences, watch movies in an actual theater (vintage, I know), micro-manage my online presence, mentor cool people, and cuddle with my boyfriend. Publishing stuff online.
