# Tell us about a challenging project that you worked on or a challenge in your life that you have overcome.

Never having anyone to relate to just based off more superficial things (race, gender, cultural background, etc.) can actually be really difficult sometimes.

Within the tech community, there are usually bubbles formed around people of certain backgrounds and for the most part, I tend to not fit into them being Latina.

When you're literally the only female minority or Latina in the room all the time, it starts to feel isolating and discouraging.

There are times when I get really tired of this and become depressed but I always manage to tell myself that this is a field I want to stay in and one I can be successful in as long as I keep at it.
