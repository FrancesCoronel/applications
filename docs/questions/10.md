# What are the classes in computer science you've taken so far?

My first formal CS class covered the fundamentals of C++ in summer 2013 at a local community college.

Later, I decided to study CS abroad for a semester in Germany and took formal courses in Python and Java.

I transferred to Hampton University to continue my studies in CS afterward and started taking more programming courses, becoming formally exposed to C, C++, Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, and Android development with Java.

I attended Fullstack Academy in the summer of 2015 and was taught the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js).

After Fullstack Academy, I started working professionally as a developer.
