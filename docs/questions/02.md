# Tell us about a time you built something awesome in code. How did you choose it? Why did you enjoy it?

Every fall, leading startups, companies, and organizations in NYC pose business challenges to Cornell Tech, which is where I happen to be getting my Master’s in CS right now. Teams are then tasked to develop and present new products, services, and strategies that respond to those challenges.

My team of 3 ladies (including myself) recently finished responding to The New York Times (Community) challenge which was as follows: “How might we create a safe place for people of all backgrounds to discuss important local, national, and global issues?”

My team interpreted being able to solve this challenge by creating a feature that would invite more folks of different backgrounds to participate in news discussion. Ultimately, we ended up creating the Q&A platform which directly solicited the opinions of readers by asking questions based off of article text analysis and user reading history.

Ultimately, the reason it's one my favorite project thus far and why I also feel it is a time where I felt I was building something awesome in code is because all three of us had recognized how important being able to increase the diversity of the user base for the New York Times was. And it’s not just because all of us came from underrepresented backgrounds in tech that we recognized this but because diversity is important for engagement, collaboration, monetization, and the overall community standards of the New York Times. Since I could relate to my team members better, I wasn't afraid of brainstorming any idea, regardless of how ludicrous.

I recently collaborated with the New York Times through Cornell Tech with a team of 3 ladies (including myself). We were tasked with creating a feature that would invite more folks of different backgrounds to participate in news discussion. My team ended up tackling this by creating the Q&A platform which directly solicited the opinions of readers by asking questions based off of article text analysis and user reading history. Ultimately, the reason it's my favorite project thus far is because we had all recognized how important being able to increase diversity of the user base was just from our personal backgrounds and because I could relate to my team members better, I wasn't afraid of brainstorming any idea, regardless of how ludicrous.
