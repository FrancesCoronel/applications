# When did you first get interested in learning to code? Why?

I was actually initially interested in bio-informatics most of my high school career. My junior year of high school, however, I figured why don’t I just major in computer science? It’s the other half of bioinformatics that I have little to no experience in. And once I finished my degree in CS, I could still do on to work in bioinformatics. It was a win, win! In the end, I got a lot more vested in the CS aspect and I haven't looked back since!
