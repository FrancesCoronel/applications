# What impact do you want to have on the world and why (500 words)?

“I know that I know nothing.” -The Socratic Paradox

At this point, I've set my heart and soul to pursuing a career in the tech industry just because every time I learn something new within the field, I feel like a child again (it's a wonderful feeling). The constant change I'll have to go through also resonates well with me since I don't like to focus on the same thing for too long and I'll never be able to claim I'm an expert for too long.

Then some days I feel silly for wanting to pursue a field with such ambition given that my family and relatives alike come from such humble backgrounds. When you're a first generation Hispanic female interested in coding, it raises some eyebrows at family gatherings. Not because it's such a terrible idea, but because it's just generally unexpected that people like me will ever stay long in this kind of field.

My prior academic history will tell you I've always tried to pursue typical life events at an earlier age and am constantly trying to involve myself with the non-familiar. I entered primary school earlier, took numerous college classes through dual enrollment all throughout high school starting at the age of 13, graduated high school at the top of my class, graduated with from college as valedictorian for the computer science department and now intend to receive my master's by the age of 21. For me, it's never been the rush, but the thrill of the experiences I've gone through that have compelled me to be crazy enough to seek them out time and time again.

I am one of the few Latinas I know studying computer science (usually the only one in my past experiences) and because I realized the severity of my isolation so long ago, I've had a strong desire from the beginning to inspire those who want to come into the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in. Ultimately, the impact I want to have on the world lies in becoming a leader in the tech industry in order to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.
