# What are your long-term plans?

Front End Engineer or User Interface Developer who ends up transitioning to Product Management down the road.

Then ideally, I'll transition to a more senior level role like CTO, CEO, etc.

The reasons for pursuing the more ambitious route long-term relates to why I try to be so heavily involved in the tech community.

I merely want to show other people from my background that they can do these things too.

Since I happen to strongly believe in leading by example, this will hopefully lead to more Latinas in tech.
