# Talk - Web Design

Web Design for Developers

Existing slides: https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/web-design-innovation-hackathon

There are 5 key points I make throughout my talk.

1. Why should I care?

Here, I reveal a perspective on the design approaches of companies that are overtaking billion dollar industries through one unifying secret advantage: the transformative power of design.

2. What is it anyways?

I elaborate on all the different design roles there are out there now, from Product Designer to Interaction Designer and how they all work with developers in one aspect or another. I talk about the 3 key principles

3. Up and Coming

I talk about the tools designers in tech use today and what styles/themes can be seen in the forefront of web design these days (Material Design, Flat, etc.).

4. Good Practices

I show through various examples how good design is essentially good business and this translates on a personal level too. If you make just a little bit effort on the design of your web product and not just the technical aspects, you'll go a lot farther with employers.

5. Bad Practices

The flip side of good practices - this section talks about how some tech companies have failed when it comes to designing for the user first and foremost.

6. No, seriously â€” why should you care?

I briefly talk about how good design can help you win hackathons, land a job, and show the trailer for the documentary "Design Disruptors" which explores how design is becoming a competitive advantage for tech companies.

Good design is building a product around users and keeping its branding consistent. Most people don't understand this and fail to incorporate good design into their otherwise technically impressive web apps. If no one wants to use your application because they can't trust the design then there's no point in creating said application without first considering design.
My goal is to try and make the audience understand, recognize, and appreciate good web design so that when they're coding out their projects in the future, they'll remember this talk and think about how they can make their product look and feel great for their users as well.

I have three key action items at the end: 1) sign up for "Design for Hackers" newsletter, 2) read up on design principles through UXPin, and 3) start a small projects that incorporate design elements learned.

I've given this talk on web design three times already to both small and large audiences. Having taken an online course on web design, my understanding of how important design is for developers has been solidified.

Simply put, I love being at the intersection of design & development and being able to help out budding developers in this industry understand design just a little bit better would be a great opportunity.
