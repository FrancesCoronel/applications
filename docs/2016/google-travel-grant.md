As a budding front-end web developer, WWW directly addresses the tools and topics I need to learn about. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skills whenever necessary. It's what I love most about the work I do - the constant change of it all and how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time.

As a graduating CS major, I'm just about to embark on my new career for web development/design. Going to such a tight niche conference like the WWW would really set on my right path to a good start in my career.

I will also note that I'm making it my personal goal this year to attend more tech conferences since I realized that every time I've attended one, it's been ridiculously beneficial to my personal growth. You can read more about that here: http://fvcproductions.com/2016/01/04/new-epoch-new-exploits/

For my story of diversity, we'll have to go back in time.

So, back in 2012 when I was still in high school and still in the stage of going through tutorials on Codecademy, I realized that at the pace I was learning within my formal education system, I was never going to be able to keep up with all the new greatness in tech that was out there. At the time, I was just getting into the realm of computer science and coding and it dawned on me how much more I was learning outside of school (mostly online) than within the confines of my very square like high school building. I made it my goal then to not limit myself to the limits of the core curriculum at my brick and mortar school and pushed myself to learn everything I could in whichever way possible.

Okay, so switching back to the present, in the summer of 2015, I attended Fullstack Academy, a premier coding bootcamp specializing in full-stack JavaScript web development located in NYC. If you don't know what a coding bootcamp is, they're basically 9 week programs (on average) that are supposed to fully immerse you in a specific skill set related to technology. Since 2012, they've expanded to all parts of the world and field sets, such as UI/UX, Product Management, Data Science, Digital Marketing, and many more.

Coding bootcamps are being heralded now as having the ability to diversity the tech scene given that they're designed for high impact and speed. They're also a lot cheaper than getting a standard 4 year degree (they cost on average $9.5K while a private out of state CS degree costs on average $120K) and that's what I loved about Fullstack Academy. There were actually a decent # of Hispanics there and almost half of the students in attendance were female (we even had our own support group). Recently even, Fullstack Academy expanded to open Grace Hopper Academy, a full-stack JS coding bootcamp for just females that charges them the tuition only after the students get a job.

Now, my Fullstack story is more of a positive one but to be honest, I don't have a terribly sad story to share about being a minority in tech except having faced your standard micro-agressions here and there. *sigh*

HOWEVER, I have faced something not necessarily sad, but downright scary. When I was the only female (not to mention only one of two minorities) speaker at a tech conference I recently attended, I wasn't sad, I was just scared. A sort of "Yikes!" kind of scared because it meant to me that because of their limited representation, I would have to act as the voice of all Hispanic and females. If I didn't represent myself well, the image for the rest of those who looked like me who be demeaned for all the audience members. The next time any of my audience members encountered someone like me, would they look back and think of the impression I made to them? Would I ever be seen as a role model to them? And who is my role model anyways? I can't even say now that I know any famous female Hispanics in the tech world that could serve as my role model.

Maybe I just need to get out more.
