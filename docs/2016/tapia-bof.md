## BOF Session Proposal: Coding Bootcamps

Many top tech companies in Silicon Valley struggle with finding tech-savvy women and minorities. This is usually because they limit the majority of their recruiting efforts to the likes of Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon, and the Ivy League. Given that these schools are predominantly white and Asian, the majority of their employees are much the same.  

However, over the last few years, numerous venture capital-backed coding bootcamps have emerged that offer the opportunity to provide Silicon Valley with a more diverse pool of candidates with many of these programs provide tuition plans and large scholarships that are more welcoming to low-income students than traditional universities.

The impact that these tailored programs are having on the tech industry is extremely evident and has already propagated to cities across the world. Large companies hire graduates of these programs have and are even partnering with some of them to provide free classes. By providing welcoming learning spaces, more affordable course and flexible schedules, coding bootcamps are expanding the talent pipeline and successfully bringing in a more diverse set of individuals into tech. 

This BOF session will serve to provide a high-level explanation of coding bootcamps to someone completely new to the concept and aims to expose the opportunity both undergrad and graduate students have with coding bootcamps to serve as a supplement to their computer science education.

Frances Coronel is a recent graduate of Hampton University with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. She attended Fullstack Academy the summer of 2015 and has been following the coding bootcamp scene since 2012. Through her mentoring and outreach, she hopes to bring more minorities into the tech field. Frances is originally from Norfolk, VA and is currently a grad student majoring in Software Engineering.
