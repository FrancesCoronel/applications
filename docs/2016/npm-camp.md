# NPM Camp

> 2016

Someone from my local dev group (757Dev.org) told me through Slack that npm.camp was offering diversity scholarships. I figured "Hey! I've used npm for 2 years now! Why not give it a shot?". So here I am. Hi there.

NPM is amazing. The first time I realized this was this past summer when a friend of mine made this npm package to download manga (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mangaweb). I had encouraged him to share it through some networks and within a few days it had already had over 800 downloads.

I'm more into front-end web development and product design and will `npm i` all the time but even so I have yet to transition to the point where I'm able to dabble with creating npm packages of my very own.

I'm hoping to learn how to get started with that transition and meet developers smarter than I am who are friendly and open. The people are what it's all about in the end after all.

npm i -g npmcamp
