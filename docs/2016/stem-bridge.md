# STEM Bridge

> 2016

## What areas of STEM interest you? Why? What STEM related career would you like to have in the future? Why? Describe any STEM-related extra-curricular activities in which you have participated.

At the start of my life, I'd thought I'd be pursuing a career in biology which then refocused to zoology, which then shifted to bioinformatics, which ultimately led to my love of computer science, specifically in AI. I've always been a STEM sort of person.

Consequently, I'm currently majoring in Computer Science at Hampton University, but I am more interested specifically in genetic algorithms within the area of artificial intelligence due to its multi-dimensionality and untapped potential services for humanity.
Naturally, however, I will not be ready to tackle the kind of challenges that AI will present in the future with just a Bachelor's degree, so I'm looking forward to getting my Master's in Artificial Intelligence following graduation and then entering industry.

Ergo, in an ideal future, I hope to be able to apply my knowledge of biological research techniques in combination with the advanced use of artificial intelligence (specifically within the realm of genetic algorithms) as a software engineer in the hopes of positively benefiting humanity. In the words of the fictional character Peter Weyland, “We [will be able to] create cybernetic individuals who in just a few short years will be completely indistinguishable from us”. I merely want to speed along that indistinguishability.

Outside of formal academic pursuits, I am the Website Committee Chair of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Student Chapter at Hampton and am in charge of the ACM website, all other ACM related social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram), and organization branding. I am also an editor for the Hampton Script, which is the student paper at Hampton, and am in charge of editing features and front page articles. Recently, I acted as a student volunteer/scholarship recipient for the 29th 1st Winter Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Conference. I also was given a travel award to attend the 2015 ACM Richard Tapia Conference in Boston, which aims at promoting diversity in computing.

I grasp in this moment more than ever that the so-called “perfect storm” has only become more prominent in communities like mine, where the minority will soon become the majority by 2043 and will be given the responsibility, inevitably, to lead a multitude of tech companies nationally. We will become the movers and the shakers, but first, we will have to resolve the issue of accessibility. Conferences like Richard Tapia's are essential in order for that accessibility to become decoded and ultimately resolved. This upcoming summer given that I intend to enroll in the intensive coding bootcamp, Fullstack Academy, where I've been accepted and generously given a large scholarship, so that I may prepare to become a leader in the tech industry, not just a follower.

I also maintain various virtual portfolios that can better showcase my projects. I enjoy graphic design, web development, and, of course, dabbling in digital hieroglyphics (aka coding). If I wish to involve myself in something due to interest, it will be without hesitation. It is a vice and a virtue because while I get a much broader range of experiences than the average person, I have yet to dedicate my full focus on any single subject. Through my website and these various portfolios, I am open with each and every experience I've gone through and how it changed me as a person because they do change me.
