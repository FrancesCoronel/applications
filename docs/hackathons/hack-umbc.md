# HackUMBC 2016

If I find a good group of front and backend developers, I'd be willing to create the first prototype for this app I've been thinking of called JeopardizeMe that aims to provide educators with a web app that makes it's easy to create Jeopardy presentations for students in order to engage the classroom.

I want to go to HackUMBC for the same reason I want to go to any hackathon - to meet people who are like me in the sense that they enjoy being a wizard in their free time and can create something magical with their wands (or just a decent text editor).
