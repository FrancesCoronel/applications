# IDEO

> October 2017

I want to participate in the CoLab makeathon because...*

I admire IDEO's design thinking driven philosophy a lot and while I've been able to apply it at work sometimes, being able to participate in such an event that will be creating positive impact using IDEO's own empathy-driven design process is just such a rare opportunity I do not want pass up.

The CoLab is about technology led design. We work with emerging technologies including blockchains and artificial intelligence and in industries like financial services, energy, healthcare, retail, insurance and automotive. Tell us a little about why one or more of these technologies applied to one of these industries excites you!

With the advent of self-driving cars, it is important for us to understand how much trust we are putting in our machines. With a personal computer or cell phone, we trust them with our data, with an autonomous car, we trust it with our lives. Not only the lives of those in the car but the lives of those around us. I think that exploration of the relationship between a driver and an autonomous vehicle is an interesting one that many will be pondering and problem-solving for years to come.

My background and skills are valuable and relevant to this makeathon because...*

I am in essence a doer. If I find myself with a problem I know I can solve, I go out and find a solution or create one myself. You can see this through the numerous amount of open contributions I've made across the interwebs, in the form of open-source work, presentation talks, documents, answers on Quora, designs, and videos.
