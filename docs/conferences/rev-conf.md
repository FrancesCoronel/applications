> So You Want To Be A Wizard

It's not easy being a digital wizard. One flick of your wand (or a good text editor) and suddenly you have something amazing in front of you. And ridiculously complicated. At some point, your code just transforms itself into its own form of digital hieroglyphics.

Okay, but here's the thing. You're not at that point yet. You want to be, but you're still trying to get the hang of what recursion really really is. So you want to be a wizard. BUT as of right now you're not really sure you have the best plan of action for getting into Hogwarts.

In this talk, I'll be talking about the most beneficial actions and habits you can learn right now that will serve as the best trajectory for getting your dev career started. Together, we'll explore all the options you have available to you in terms of applications, plugins, physical and online programs, learning tools, events, etc. in order to start your own high-impact learning path.

In just 30 minutes, I'll show you how you can transform yourself from the newbie Dobey to the grand master Gandalf when it comes to digital wizardry.

* This talk is targeted for those still in the process of learning the basics of programming and software development (code newbies).
