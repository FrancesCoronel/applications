# GitHub Universe

So someone from my company, Accenture, told me through Slack that GitHub Universe was offering scholarships. I figured "Hey! I've been passionately pushing commits to GitHub for 4 years! Why not give it a shot?". So here I am. Hi there. I'm Frances.

I'm a 21-year-old Latina developer with a panache for design. I just started my first full-time job as a software engineer at Accenture's Liquid Studio in Redwood City, CA.

I personally get a lot of personal satisfaction out of helping the local tech community through my varied skill set by speaking at tech Meetups and mentoring potential coding bootcamp students.

My past work experience includes working part-time as a front-end developer while in my last semester of college at a local consulting agency called 80|20 in Norfolk, VA. Later, I interned as a wearables developer for Accenture Liquid Studio in Redwood City, CA during summer 2016. This spring, I mentored folks as an ambassador for Fullstack Academy.

In terms of my academic background, I recently graduated with a Master's in Computer Science from Cornell Tech in May of this year. Before that, I received a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Hampton University last May and have been attending various external programs like Fullstack Academy (web development), Designlab (web design), and Product School (product management).

I am one of the few Latinas I know who has studied computer science and now works as a software engineer (the only one at work right now even) and because I recognized this isolation so long ago, I've had a strong desire from the beginning to want to inspire those who want to come into the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in. Ultimately, my goal lies in becoming a leader in the field in other to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.

So why GitHub Universe?

Well, as a budding software engineer, GitHub Universe directly addresses the tools and topics I want to develop my skills in. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skill set whenever necessary. It's what I love most about the work I do - the constant change of it all and how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time. Going to such a tight niche conference like GitHub Universe would really set on my right path to a great start to what I hope will be a long career in the tech industry.

GitHub is amazing. The first time I last recognized this was when I used the open source project docsify to create a resource for Fullstack Academy graduates when looking for a job. Fullstack Academy is a coding bootcamp I attended back in 2015. A lot of graduates ended up using it and found it very useful! If I had used traditional outlets instead of GitHub to try and find a documentation generator, it would have taken me a lot longer and would have been a lot more tedious to swiftly deploy such a resource for anyone to use.

With this conference, I'm hoping to not only learn the latest and greatest developments within the GitHub community but I also hope to be able to meet developers smarter than I am who are friendly and as open as the projects they maintain. The people are what it's all about in the end after all.

Since I am a recent graduate of a Master's program and only just started working, it would be really helpful to obtain funding for conference expenses. This will be my first opportunity to attend GitHub Universe and I feel that the opportunity to meet with leaders in the field will be an excellent platform to establish myself and gain new insight in open-source software development. I hope that the committee can look favorably on my application.
