# Grace Hopper Celebration 2016 Application

By attending the Grace Hopper Celebration, I’ll be given the rare victory of networking with and becoming stimulated by those of similar ethnic origins to mine who also share the same gender. Given that this conference was built from the ground up by an inspirational female figure who has already aided generations of underrepresented female students such as myself to pursue STEM careers (which is my intention) only makes that victory all the sweeter.

I grasp in this moment more than ever that the so-called “perfect storm” has only become more prominent in communities like mine, where the minority will soon become the majority by 2050 and will be given the responsibility, inevitably, to lead a multitude of tech companies nationally. This conference is essential in order for that difficulty to become decoded and ultimately resolved.

In the words of a TED speaker and the current Chairman of Dreamworks Animation, Mellody Hobson, if we mean to solve a very difficult problem, we’re going to need a manifold of intellects, ergo, a diverse group of people involved. Hobson calls for color bravery, and I believe this conference aspires to do just that (along with also, of course, being gender brave). It exposes to students like me others who don’t resemble or behave alike so that not only my assumptions in computing can be challenged and extended, but so that I may also inclusively grow as a human being.

At Hampton University, we have a Women in Computing club that could make use of more members becoming involved. My future prospects of increasing participation can only become higher with the experience I’ll gain from a conference organized by an organization that promotes such clubs. Lastly, as a Latina in computing, I’ll also be able to heighten awareness of the possibilities in computer science career fields for other Hispanic students currently attending Hampton.

However, given that I am currently in my last semester at Hampton right now, it is more likely that I will be passing on what I learned throughout the Grace Hopper Celebration with my fellow female grad students instead.
