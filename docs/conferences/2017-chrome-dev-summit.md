# Chrome Dev Summit

> October 2017

As a budding software engineer in Lightweight Architecture, this summit directly addresses the tools and topics I want to develop further. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skill set whenever necessary.  It's what I love most about the work I do - the constant change of it all and how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time. Going to such a tight niche conference like GitHub Universe would really set on my right path to a great start to what I hope will be a long career in the tech industry.
