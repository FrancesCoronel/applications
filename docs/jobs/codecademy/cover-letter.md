# Codecademy

## Why do you want to be a design intern at Codecademy?

I have no doubt you've heard this spiel before, but yes I was one of those folks who got started programming using the Codecademy platform.

I then realized after roughly a year of venturing into the land of Lisp (thatâ€™s a joke), Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS all on my own virtually through sites like Codecademy that I LOVE CODING.

I loved feeling like this kind of digital wizard that could literally create something out of thin air (or with a good text editor).

Computer science turned into something I wanted to do for the long-term, not just this stepping stone to a higher learning quest.

Since then, I've pivoted to also have a love for creating not just digital products, but well designed digital products.

I've taken the initiative pursuing design by working on UI tweaks that I would publish to my Behance (http://behance.net/fvcproductions) and freelancing for clients through logos and website design.

I also embodied this design value whenever I spoke publicly through my presentations which you can find on my Speaker Deck (http://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions).

I have received very good feedback on my work done with Sketch and Keynote for rapid prototyping and presentation designs. My background includes internships involving web design and development using HTML/CSS/JS and optimizing the UI for Unity applications.

Through your internship, I hope to gain a lot more experience as a product designer.
