# **Hey, Box!**

Just wanted to elaborate on what I wasn’t able to cover in my video interview.

## Priority 1 - On-boarding

> making it easier for new users to understand the extent of features Box has to offer

As a potential new user of Box, I might feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of sharing, privacy, and add-ons I have available to me. Ergo, I think it would help if Box had a more extensive on-boarding process that would make it easier tor me understand the extent of what Box has to offer in a user-friendly way. On-boarding already exists through Box University but this seems more like an extensive FAQ section than a friendly on-boarding feature. There is also that question icon in the bottom right corner of the app that allows you to explore a few features of Box within the app but it doesn’t delve into a lot so adding on to this would be ideal.

## Priority 2 - Increasing Developer Friendliness

> allowing developers to get more out of the Box platform

My second priority deals with the world of AR and VR. My past internship with Accenture involved working for the wearables team which meant I helped create enterprise applications that utilized AR/VR Developers on my team for Accenture actually used Box to store Unity developer files and there was a lot of issues with being able to see clear version management and also to see where all the Unity files were. Ergo, I propose tags for the types of applications a file can be opened with - i.e. all Unity Files — all Sketch Files — all Adobe PhotoShop files - each would have their own personalized tag that the developer/designer can filter by. This would be an addition to developer-friendly icons associated with each type dev type of file.

### Random Idea - Request Files by Link

> avoid email hell!

Let’s say I’m an auto-insurance agent. I need pictures of an accident from a customer using a secure method. As this agent, I’d like to be able to email a “file request link” to my customer who can then easily upload the files to a folder in my Box company folder. Right now, you can upload to Box via email - but this feature is allowing you to just send the a file request via a specific link. Uploading with email is great, but it can fill client email system with big sent files, so it’s not always ideal.

### Random Tweaks

![random](https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/circle-icons-1/64/die-128.png)

> suggestions I’ve come up with, feel free to skim through

#### More Extensive Version Control

Also, as a user, I want to be able to preview which specific parts have been changed for version control - something similar to how GitHub does it but much less extensive.

#### Company Account Logins

As a user, I want an easy way to access company accounts without having to purchase a password manager - ergo, a file type that is essentially a secure login (`Login - YouTube Company Account`) that would allow any verified user to access the YouTube account clicking on that file.

#### Multiple Files

As a user, I want to be able to select multiple files and change the sharing settings for all of them.

#### Referral

As a user, I want to be able to get more free storage by referring other users to create an account.

#### More Data Sync Info

As a user, I want to be able to see more data when syncing to Box in menu bar (updating files x of y, time to complete, uploading at b/s, files remaining).

#### Duplicate Files

As a user, I want to be able to easily find and delete duplicate files.

#### Chrome Browser

As a Chrome user, I would like to be notified of major files changes from a shared folder through browser notifications.

#### Filter

As a user, I would like to be able to filter more easily the files that were shared with me.

#### Multiple Accounts

As a user with multiple accounts, I would like to be able to switch between my personal and work Box account.

#### Limit Syncing Overload

As a user with an older laptop, I’d like to have the option to limit the amount of CPU power Box uses for syncing.

#### Priority Downloading

As a user who needs to get things done, I’d like the ability to set priority for downloaded files.

#### Box Notes

As a user for Box notes, I’d like to see highlighted comments synced up with the comments in the sidebar and not have them separated.

#### Sketch

As a user who uses Sketch, I’d like to preview Sketch files through Box.

#### Multiple Devices, Different Folders Synced

As a user, I’d like to be able to sync different folders across multiple computers.
