# Discovery

I'm Frances - a developer with a design background who tends to get a lot of personal satisfaction out of helping the local tech community through my varied skill set.

I'm currently pursuing a MEng in Computer Science at Cornell Tech and hope to kick butt in the tech scene as a product manager after graduating in order to utilize both my design and dev skills.

I have yet to find many people with my background (a Latina in the tech industry) and skill set so I challenge you to find someone who does.
