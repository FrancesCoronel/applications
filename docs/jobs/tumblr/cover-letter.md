# Tumblr

Back in 2015, while working and studying full-time, I found tumblr to be a source of stress relief, support, endless laughs, and information that I wouldn't get anywhere else.  I cannot tell you how many times a meme, joke, video, or even hard news story has hit other social media/sources, only for my response to be "Yeah, I saw that on tumblr weeks ago." Tumblrites are plugged into what's happening in the world, heavily influenced by what already interests them, but also directed by the interests of the people they "Follow." For instance, I may follow a lot of people who watch a particular television show or those who share my same political views. I have seen other people on tumblr voice thoughts and opinions that I thought I was entirely alone in...and I've had long-held thoughts and opinions intelligently challenged.Other users have organized conventions, art projects, charity drives, elaborate social media pranks, and petitions using tumblr as a resource and medium.

In 2015, while working and studying full-time, I found Tumblr to be a wellspring of stress relief as it provided endless snickers and data that I wouldn't find anyplace else. Tumblrites are connected into what's occurring to the world, vigorously impacted by what as of now interests them, additionally coordinated by the interests of the general population they "Follow" For example, I may follow individuals who watch a specific TV program or those who share my same political perspectives. I have seen other individuals on Tumblr voice musings and sentiments that I thought I was completely alone in and I've had long-held considerations and feelings cleverly challenged. That's why I believe designing for Tumblr would be an excellent opportunity.
