Google Sheets. Excel. The two options most folks think about when they want to create a spreadsheet. But not me. No, no, no. You see, I've been using this platform called Airtable for a month now and I can't even imagine doing anything in Google Sheets, let alone Excel, any longer.

To be fair, I'm not in a job that requires the use of either but in terms of organizing data, I have found it useful to utilize spreadsheets in the past to keep track of a variety of different things. However, Google Sheets proved to be far too clunky with a spotty UI for organizing files. Wth Airtable, I feel like I can find whatever I need to in a breeze because of how easy it is to access just about any piece of data you've stored in it. The interface is seamless across mobile and web, I can share and export to whatever I want, and I can even sync data with my calendar.

So far, I've been using Airtable to keep track of deadlines, college courses, mentoring sessions, job applications, test scores, awards, all sorts of things!

But what I find interesting about Airtable is that they were able to break into a seemingly boring and crowded market (spreadsheets) and still get tons of users onboard because they put the experience of their users first.
