# Cover Letter - Software Engineer

This letter is to express my interest in your posting for your software engineer role. I’m currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell Tech in New York City, having received a BS in CS prior.

I’m interested in DoSomething because I’ve always been in a bigger believer in actions than words. It’s why I’ve taken the initiative to pursue a Master’s by the age of 21 so I can really start going out and changing the world in my own unique way.

With my past projects, I have received very good feedback on my work done using Sketch and Keynote for rapid prototyping and presentation designs. My background includes internships involving web design and development using HTML/CSS/JS as well as optimizing the UI for Unity applications.

Through this internship, I hope to gain a lot more experience in software engineering. I first started my journey into the world of digital hieroglyphics my junior year of high school and don’t intend to leave the tech scene anytime soon.

Feel free to refer to my GitHub or portfolio for more examples of my developer work.

I look forward to hearing back!
