Why?

I want to work for a company where i believe in the product going forward. I also have to really believe the work is interesting. How excited I am to come to work every day is ridiculously essential for me to stay with any company. I was given an offer to return to Accenture in August of this year. They were offering me a 6 figure salary at the age of 20 and I turned it down last month because I just didn’t think the work was for me. They had benefits, the people were nice, yadda yadda.

What was your favorite project/job and what was your least favorite?

NYTimes — Google Hackathon
Describe a time that you failed and how you handled it.
I was at a Google hackathon. I failed.
Recent happenings?
Telemundo coming out with new musical
And new VR skit

What experience do you have that would help you for this position?

Since 2012, I’ve been learning how to code. It’s a never-ending process. And since 2013, I’ve been working on my own designs. I’ve had two past gigs before this - one with Accenture, a global consulting company, where I was a wearables developer and another with a much smaller consulting group of less than 10 people in my hometown of Norfolk, VA.
In other words, I have experience with both designing and developing products but to take that even further, I’m taking a product management class right now with Product School and am one of the youngest students to be accepted at the age of 20.

What is your great weakness?

 Too picky, perfectionist. Got nagged about this when I was working with my NYTimes team.

What do you know about the NBC Universal?

Merged with Universal Studio, used to be owned by GE but now owned by Comcast as of 2013. One of the largest media conglomerates in the world. You own everything important to me. Comcast owns Fandango, where I book my tickets which owns Flixster and Rotten Tomatoes

What do you hope to gain?

More experience in product strategy, development, and design. Digital Products & Interactive Media. If there are any mobile projects, I’d like a chance to learn more about mobile development.

What qualities make a good intern/employee and how did you display these traits in your past job(s)?

At my internship with Accenture, I had 3 key required tasks: optimize unity applications for client delivery, update record of all wearables devices and install latest version of client showcasing app, and create a website showcasing all these wearable devices. I did all this in addition to presenting on the wearables team and contributing to the knowledge base for incoming employees.
