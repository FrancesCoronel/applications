Thinkful Mentor

I used to be able to mentor a lot of potential coding bootcamp students back when I was in school and an ambassador for Fullstack Academy, a coding bootcamp in NYC. However,  I haven't been able to do that as much recently since starting a new job since Fullstack Academy would provide me the initial connection with the mentees.

I think mentoring in the past has made me not just a better developer but a better sharer of knowledge which is a skill that can be applied while presenting at conferences and just being an evangelist in general.

Since I'm interested in being a better developer and technical speaker, I figured I would try and see if I can find an easier way to also mentor eager beginners.

I'm a very big proponent of coding bootcamps both online and offline so I've been familiar with Thinkful for a while and I can see it's been on a very healthy upward trajectory.

In conclusion, I'd like to become a part of the Thinkful community.
