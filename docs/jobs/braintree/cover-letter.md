## Dear Braintree

This letter is to express my interest in your posting for the PM intern role. I’m currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at [Cornell Tech](http://tech.cornell.edu) in New York City, having received a [Bachelor’s in Computer Science](https://fvcproductions.com/home/adventures/schools/hampton-university/) prior.

With my past projects, I have received very good feedback on my work done using [Sketch](http://behance.net/fvcproductions) and [Keynote](http://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions) for rapid prototyping and presentation designs. My background includes internships involving [web design and development](https://fvcproductions.com/home/adventures/experience/80-20/) using HTML/CSS/JS as well as [optimizing the UI for Unity applications](https://fvcproductions.com/home/adventures/experience/accenture-liquid-studio/).

Through this internship, I hope to gain a start in a PM career. Since I have experience with design and development already, I took the initiative this past fall by attending a part-time product management course in New York City through [Product School](http://productschool.com). At 20, I was one of the youngest students they have ever accepted but given my experience, they decided to admit me. I have since graduated and gone on to read ["Cracking the PM Interview"](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-PM-Interview-Product-Technology/dp/0984782818) on my own. Ideally, this internship would lead to a full-time position at Braintree afterwards.

> I was asked to address the following.

##### How would I improve a feature on one of my favorite apps, [Simple](https://simple.com)?

To provide some context, Simple is a free, all-digital checking account designed to be used mostly on your smartphone. It comes with a Visa debit card and a handful of first-rate mobile banking tools.

So I've been a Simple user since 2014. I pay no fees and I love using my Simple card to pay for everything since the mobile app provides me the most intuitive interface I've been able to find in my brief time so far when it comes to interacting with banking apps. The mobile app provides such a wonderful interface to view exactly what I spent my money on. The transaction notifications are instantaneous, a gesture I'm not afforded with the Chase mobile app. I'm actually in the process of transferring all my money to Simple now since it's proven to be such a superior experience compared to even the most experienced competitors like Chase.

However, no app is perfect and that's why I propose Simple creates a macOS app that lives in the menu bar and provides an overview of transactions with just the tap of a trackpad (or click of the mouse). There wouldn't be any ability to move around money for security reasons but instead the app would act as a method to easily view financial information.

You see, while I love using my phone on the go, I rarely use it while working on actual projects. When I'm really working, I'm consistently on my laptop and may only look at my phone every now and then. The service, [Mint](http://mint.com), actually provided such a service to their customers a while ago but it has since been [discontinued](https://mint.lc.intuit.com/questions/1244369-discontinuing-the-mac-quickview-app).

I think the folks at Mint underestimated the customer satisfaction that this simple menu bar app brought. Without having to log in and their transactions being automatically updated, users had no barrier to the information they wanted to see.

To quote from a [complaint](https://mint.lc.intuit.com/replies/2807070) off of Mint's post announcing the discontinuation, *"Quickview was a phenomenal tool that I used every single day, multiple times a day. I told all my friends and students about it as well. I am very disappointed about the way this was handled. I would be happy to pay to have this service back"*.

If Simple were to learn from Mint's mistake and create an app that would remove such barriers whilst working on a PC, I believe they would not only greatly benefit from user satisfaction but that such a feature would enrich their integrated ecosystem even further.

Feel free to refer to my portfolio links below for more examples of my development, design, and presentation work.

I look forward to hearing back!
