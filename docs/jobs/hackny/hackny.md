# **hackNY**

## Tell us about a time you built something awesome in code. How did you choose it? Why did you enjoy it?

Every fall, leading startups, companies, and organizations in NYC pose business challenges to Cornell Tech, which is where I happen to be getting my Master’s in CS right now. Teams are then tasked to develop and present new products, services, and strategies that respond to those challenges.

My team of 3 ladies (including myself) recently finished responding to The New York Times (Community) challenge which was as follows: “How might we create a safe place for people of all backgrounds to discuss important local, national, and global issues?”

My team interpreted being able to solve this challenge by creating a feature that would invite more folks of different backgrounds to participate in news discussion. Ultimately, we ended up creating the Q&A platform which directly solicited the opinions of readers by asking questions based off of article text analysis and user reading history.

Ultimately, the reason it's one my favorite project thus far and why I also feel it is a time where I felt I was building something awesome in code is because all three of us had recognized how important being able to increase the diversity of the user base for the New York Times was. And it’s not just because all of us came from underrepresented backgrounds in tech that we recognized this but because diversity is important for engagement, collaboration, monetization, and the overall community standards of the New York Times. Since I could relate to my team members better, I wasn't afraid of brainstorming any idea, regardless of how ludicrous.

## Why is hackNY right for you?

At this point, I've set my heart and soul to pursuing a career as a developer just because every time I learn something new within the field, I feel like a child again (it's a wonderful feeling). The constant change I'll have to go through also resonates well with me since I don't like to focus on the same thing for too long and I'll never be able to claim I'm an expert for too long.

Then some days I feel silly for wanting to pursue a field with such ambition given that my family and relatives alike come from such humble backgrounds. When you're a first generation Latina interested in coding, it raises some eyebrows at family gatherings. Not because it's such a terrible idea, but because it's just generally unexpected that people like me will ever stay long in this kind of field. Damned lies and statistics, indeed.

To mitigate this fear, I have to reassure myself constantly whenever I'm dealing with something difficult academically or technically that the mastery of any field requires a grand amount of time, passion, and dedication. I try instead to view my academic struggles as small obstacles I have to either overcome or diverge from by finding a sub-field within that struggle more suited to my skill-set.

My prior academic history will tell you I've always tried to pursue typical life events at an earlier age and I am constantly trying to involve myself with the non-familiar. I entered primary school earlier, took numerous college classes through dual enrollment all throughout high school starting at the age of 13, ended up graduating high school at the top of my class at an age younger than the majority and now intend to receive my master's by the age of 21. For me, it's never been the rush, but the thrill of the experiences I've gone through that have compelled me to be crazy enough to seek them out time and time again.

However, even now, I’ve never worked for a startup before. So for starters, I’d like to know what that’s like through hackNY. I mean, I feel like I’ve worked at companies that embody that startup culture, for sure, but never myself been able to actually experience it heads on. I also want to test the waters further in the NYC tech scene.

And albeit the fact that my mind has been set on venturing into Silicon Valley and finding work there, I’ve spent enough time in New York City (through Fullstack Academy and now Cornell Tech) to recognize what a vibrant and (way more) diverse community the tech scene in New York can be. I can feel it pulling me in so I want to actually let it by immersing myself entirely within the workforce and getting a taste for what it is like to be a part of a cool startup in NYC instead of SF.

I’ve done my research and I’m positive that this is the sort of experience that hackNY can give me. I’ve looked through the LinkedIn profiles of past fellows and found myself thoroughly impressed at where they’ve ended up.

I know at this point I want to take that extra step and ideally with the skills I'll learn through the hackNY program, I too will be able to inspire others in the tech scene and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.

## Tell us about what you hope to learn this summer.

I’m hoping to learn what it is like to work at a startup in Silicon Alley instead of the Valley and absorb as much technical aptitude as I can from whichever company I’m lucky enough to get paired up with.

The idea of participating in a project that involves social impact around diversity in tech is also ridiculously intriguing to me because I’ve dedicated a lot of time to the effort through many different avenues (mentoring potential bootcamp students, freelancing for/speaking at/attending conferences that promote diversity).

## Starting this year, in an initiative led by our alumNY and reflecting their community values, all 2017 hackNY Fellows will participate in a project which promotes positive social impact, especially around increasing diversity and inclusivity in tech. Tell us about social good initiatives that you are excited about or problems you would like to see solved by social impact projects, why they are important to you, and what you would hope to accomplish with social good as a part of hackNY and beyond.

So coding bootcamps are growing more and more popular each year. If you’re not familiar already, coding bootcamps themselves are short-term (3 months give or take) programs in software development that promise graduates new careers in technology. These schools, now backed by hundreds of millions in VC funding, educated about 30K students in 2016, and rake in just shy of half a billion in tuition fees.

Such programs are allowing more folks from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds to make a transition into the tech field and earn salaries well above the national average. The whole field of coding bootcamps is of great interest to me and I’ve been following them since the beginning when DevBootcamp started opening up their Ruby on Rails course.
Even the creator of “Cracking the Coding Interview” has gone ahead and vouched for them herself recently through a Medium article (https://medium.freecodecamp.com/so-that-whole-coding-bootcamp-thing-is-a-scam-right-6fddf14087d4#.meynkdi7c).

I myself attended Fullstack Academy, a coding bootcamp in Wall Street that focuses on teaching fullstack JS web development, back in the summer of 2015 as part of their inaugural Summer of Code class. The whole “Summer of Code” program targeted college students who wanted to earn the skills that would land them top internships in the tech field.
While I was at Fullstack, I worked on two minor side projects that focused on the coding bootcamp industry.

The first project was a map of all the coding bootcamps out there because I didn't see any existing solution in place. It has gotten over 16K hits on Google Maps alone but I recently created a crowd-sourced version as well. Either way, both of these are the two top results on Google for the search query "map of coding bootcamps”. You can find out more here: https://fvcproductions.com/portfolio/mapme-coding-bootcamps/.

 The second project I never fully finished was a rank analyzer that aggregated reviews from across the web and ranked coding bootcamps based off these. You can find out more here: [_https://fvcproductions.com/portfolio/rankme/_](https://fvcproductions.com/portfolio/rankme/).

By investing a lot of time in the subject, I found that a key pain point for a lot of potential coding bootcamp students is whether or not they’ll really be able to get a job right afterward and how trustworthy the coding bootcamp they want to attend actually is. Even now, the Flatiron School (http://flatironschool.com) is one of the very few coding bootcamps in the world with an independently verified job placement report for all graduates.

Granted, there have been efforts to address this issue. In early 2015, a group of coding schools sent a letter to President Barack Obama, pledging to release standardized and audited outcome reports. But that never happened…

So in terms of social good, I’d want to make a standardized job report a reality for all coding bootcamps by creating a platform that automatically parses information from LinkedIn and Glassdoor. So for example, it would grab the job title from a coding bootcamp grad off LinkedIn and then predict their salary using Glassdoor. The platform could also validate alumni reviews by aggregating them from across the web (Yelp, Quora, Course Report, techendo, etc.). Ultimately, I’d want to add a layer of trustworthiness to coding bootcamps which have no standard measurements for job placement rates and will go as far as trying to hide negative reviews.

The demand for this kind of product is very high and here are two recent articles that speak more on this: Could coding boot camps see stricter standards? (Nov 2016) (http://www.myajc.com/news/technology/could-coding-boot-camps-see-stricter-standards/ns4kQ/) and Students are demanding the facts about coding bootcamps (Aug 2016) (https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/25/students-are-demanding-the-facts-about-coding-bootcamps/).

Given the fact that a lot of folks who might not have had the means to earn a CS degree are now looking into coding bootcamps as their golden opportunity to enter the tech scene, I find it imperative that such programs are held accountable if they are not delivering on their promises. As programs like these attempt to diversify this industry, I’d want to ultimately make sure they succeed.

## Is there a particular technology or industry you're currently interested in? How come? Where do you see it heading in the future?

Yes, I think coding bootcamps are going to be seen as a viable way of getting a job in the tech industry versus the standard getting a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from a university.

Programs like Coursera and Udacity have already provided a lot of free premier educational resources for those who cannot afford a traditional degree and I find them quite beneficial but the completion rates for online courses can’t be ignored and I’ve experienced personally how difficult it can be to become disciplined enough to learn on your own unless it is highly interactive. I believe it is part of the reason coding bootcamps are doing so well financially since they’re able to charge for that in-person classroom like setting. I don’t like saying the word classroom because it has such a negative connotation in my mindset but regardless, a lot of folks see coding bootcamps as the more viable option in terms of time, commitment, and money. And a lot of the time, it is.

So all in all, I believe coding bootcamps in the future will either find themselves being incorporated into the CS curriculum by top schools who can afford it (which is already happening) or transforming into another trusted avenue of getting a job in the tech industry.

## Discuss your technical skills/proficiencies/languages and experience

First formal CS class I ever took was in the summer of 2013 at a local community college in the fundamentals of C++. Later, I decided to study CS abroad for a semester in Germany and took formal courses in Python and Java. I transferred to Hampton University to continue my studies in CS afterward and started taking more programming courses, becoming formally exposed to C, C++, Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, and Android development with Java.

While at Hampton, I attended Fullstack Academy in the summer of 2015 and was taught the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js). Before Fullstack, my favorite language was Python. It is now JS.

My first real job was at 80|20 Software Consulting, which I was able to get shortly after graduating from Fullstack. Even though most of the projects were client based, I ended up working on an internal platform using HTML/CSS/JS and AngularJS that targeted clients who couldn’t afford the regular cost of our services and would be okay with a more automated way of maintaining their website instead. Within that role, I also consulted a few folks on their Wordpress websites.

I only ended up working at 80|20 for a few months before realizing it was interfering too much with my schooling as I was finishing my last semester of undergrad and had to complete several research projects that I didn’t enjoy very much at all.

I ended up receiving a full-time offer to work at Accenture as a technical consultant in SF upon graduating from Hampton in May 2016 but I turned it down and went with an internship instead since I decided to myself that I needed to learn some more and get a Master’s in CS too. I was also younger than the average college grad (20) and I didn’t feel it was necessary to enter the workforce immediately. At that internship, Accenture placed me in their Redwood City office which was pretty hip and “lean”. There, I was part of the very small wearables team where I worked on optimizing Unity applications to impress clients. I didn’t have any experience with Unity or consumer hardware before but I was surprised I learned as fast as I did.
The main tools/languages I used throughout my internship were Unity (C# and JS are used to create scripts), Sketch, Android Studio, Xcode, and Safari for Developers. I also helped the on-boarding team create documentation in order to prepare incoming developers on the basics of Unity and all the hardware available. Accenture offered me a full-time offer once again following the internship but alas, I turned it down already because I felt the AR/VR field isn’t really for me.
This month (December 2016), I took on a role as ambassador for Fullstack Academy, the program I mentioned earlier. It is similar to being a dev evangelist but it doesn’t really require any technical acumen. Just a lot of passion for Fullstack and what it offers.

However, this upcoming spring I’ll also be interning as a Media Tech intern for NBCUniversal under their senior VP of technology in the news division. While I don’t know the full details, I’m supposed to be working on optimizing the UI for internal video tools.

It’s pretty clear that my experience thus far has been mostly with larger corporations. I’m expecting this to change. Hence, hackNY.

## When you're not coding, what do you like to do?

Attend Meetups, obsess over the latest and greatest productivity/coding tools (via Product Hunt mostly), question Quora, discover a song on Spotify and repeat it over and over till I get sick of it, blog/write/read, attend/speak at/freelance at tech conferences, watch movies in an actual theater (vintage, I know), micro-manage my online presence, mentor cool people, and cuddle with my boyfriend. I also have quite a "panache" for design.

## What sectors would you especially like to work in? (e.g., fashion, data science, media, art, education...)

Education, Hackathons, Collaboration, Dating, Crowdsourcing, Entertainment, Consulting, Self Improvement, Presentations, Financial, Blogging, Writing Platforms

## What sectors would you prefer not to work in?

Fashion, Retail, Machine Learning, Social Networks

## Any free text you'd like us to add when describing you to proposed host startups?

Hiya, there! I'm Frances.

I consider myself a developer with a design background and I tend to get a lot of personal satisfaction out of helping the local tech community through my varied skill set. So far, I've dedicated over 25 hours of my free time towards mentoring folks 1-on-1 virtually and have had the chance to speak or attend numerous well-known tech conferences.

Academically speaking, I'm pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Cornell Tech right now and hope to kick butt in the tech scene as a product gal after graduating in order to utilize both my design and dev skills.

For the spring of 2017, I'll also be working at NBCUniversal at their headquarters under their senior VP of technology in their news division to optimize the UI of internal applications. I also decided to take on the role of summer of code ambassador for Fullstack Academy, which I attended myself back in the summer of 2015.

With my past projects, I have received very good feedback for my rapid prototyping and presentation designs. My background includes internships involving web design and development using HTML/CSS/JS as well as optimizing Unity app UIs. Since I have some experience with product design already, I took the initiative this past fall (2016) by attending a part-time product management course through Product School in order to see what I was missing in terms of business acumen.

To be perfectly honest, I don't consider myself either a hardcore developer or designer - but a bit of both instead. The best of both worlds is where my true passion lies.

## Tell us why you wrote this code and what it does.

I wrote this code for an interview with Duolingo actually. I was applying to be a PM intern and part of their interview consisted of creating a deployed app that would check if two words were anagrams of each other. I was actually able to get through every round of interviews with them until the very end when the recruiter ended up letting me know they were no longer hiring for any PM position since they’re restricting their company eni

I was using JavaScript to write it and came across a solution that just used a bunch of built-in functions. I'm really into one-liners for simple algorithm problems because I appreciate the efficiency that goes into it. With the parameters of the two strings, we can check if they're anagrams by splitting the strings into characters, sorting those characters, and then joining them together, thereby creating an entire array of words formed by the mixing of characters in the given string. We compare these two arrays of words to each other for each string given, and bam — we know if they're anagrams of each other!
