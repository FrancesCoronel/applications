## Three digital experiences that you find interesting (apps, websites, wearables, environments, etc.) and why.

1. Airtable

When most people think of spreadsheets (which hopefully isn't often, frankly), they tend to think that Excel or Google Sheets will be their best option. These people are unfortunately very mistaken. You see, I've been using this platform called Airtable for a month now and I can't even imagine doing anything in Google Sheets, let alone Excel, anymore.

To be fair, I'm not in a job that requires the use of either but in terms of organizing data, I have found it useful to utilize spreadsheets in the past to keep track of a variety of different things. However, Google Sheets proved to be far too clunky with a spotty UI for organizing files. Wth Airtable, I feel like I can find whatever I need to in a breeze because of how easy it is to access just about any piece of data you've stored in it. The interface is seamless across mobile and web, I can share and export to whatever I want, and I can even sync data with my calendar.

So far, I've been using Airtable to keep track of deadlines, college courses, mentoring sessions, job applications, test scores, awards, all sorts of things!

But what I find interesting about Airtable is that they were able to break into a seemingly boring and crowded market (spreadsheets) and still get tons of users onboard because they put the experience of their users first.

2. HoloLens

As a wearables developer at Accenture Liquid Studio this past summer, I was able to get exposed to dozens of different types of wearable devices, including Google Glass and Microsoft's HoloLens.

As you're probably already aware, the HoloLens is actually the first consumer-oriented product that is trying to bring augmented reality to the mainstream.

But what I actually find interesting about the HoloLens is where it tried to improve where Google Glass obviously failed. I feel Microsoft really succeeded in marketing a product that is not meant to be worn on the face throughout the day, unlike how Google marketed Glass.

The HoloLens is seen inside throughout all the commercials. Microsoft made it clear that Hololens is ONLY meant to be worn when you require it, like when you are working, playing, skyping and watching movies. All the product applications were targeting specializations that happened inside, furthering the message the product isn't meant to be worn in public.

This entire marketing/product strategy made sure that HoloLens users would never get stigmatized for not paying attention or looking odd and out of place which is how a lot of Glass users felt like. Glass was a big rare failure by Google and the HoloLens made sure to learn from that.

3. Quora

I love the platform Quora and use it at least once every week. In case you're not familiar, Quora is a question-and-answer site where questions are asked, answered, edited and organized by its community of users.

Now, to be perfectly honest, before reading the book “Hooked” by Nir Eyal, I was actually using Quora multiple times a day — and became somewhat obsessed with answering questions I felt I could answer. However, the reason I find Quora so interesting now is because of how this book really opened my eyes to how their hooked model works.

The hooked model Eyal talks about in his book distills ideas from BJ Fogg's behavior model of 'triggers leading to repeatable actions leading to the acquisition of rewards'. But Fogg basically focused more on 'individuals' to help them to reform their habits whereas the 'hooked model' talks at length about how companies can take advantage of people's tendency to form habits. Companies like Quora.

Every hooked model has 4 different components: 1) a trigger which is what brings the user to the product (curiosity), 2) an action that will provide the simplest anticipation to a reward (asking or answering a question), 3) a reward that is fulfilling but leaves the user wanting more (one answer to their question asked, highlighted as an up and coming writer), and finally 4) an investment which is that little bit of work that is done by the user in order to increase the likelihood of them returning (shown questions you might be able to answer, finding other questions that you wanted to have answered).

With their model, Quora definitely hooked me but learning about the process itself was pretty fascinating, regardless.
