# Questions Asked

- Why Huge?
    + Selfish reasons. I want to be able to test my skills in design. I want to test whether or not I can see myself as not just a developer but as a software designer instead. I felt like the best way to test that is by interning for one of the most recognized design agencies in the world. If I can prove myself during the summer, it would mean reconsidering viewing myself as not just a developer, but as a hardcore designer as well.

# Points of Reference

## Aaron Shapiro - CEO of Huge

A lot of the secret sauce for us is about really understanding users and what are users trying to do when they're trying to interact with your brand. Users don't interact with brands for fun. They're there to solve a problem. The reason they interact with a digital ecosystem is to solve those problems, and what Huge does really well is understand users, understand how digital can best solve those problems, then partner with clients to create that whole ecosystem for helping meet user needs. The best companies that meet those needs have gone on to be very successful.

We've all seen the success stories of companies like Apple and Facebook that were so successful because they met users' needs, and that's set a really high bar. The challenge for every company is, 'How can their digital ecosystem be as good as of beacon brands?' That's what Huge helps its clients achieve.

## School Structure

“We designed the initial two weeks to be an intro to HUGE, and then deep dives on structure, scenarios, and wireframes using a single project to thread those lessons together. And then the rest of it is a real project they’re working on. HUGE employees come up with the project ideas and the students work on everything from strategy through to wireframes."
