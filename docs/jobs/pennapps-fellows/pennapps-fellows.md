I recently collaborated with the New York Times through Cornell Tech with a team of 3 ladies (including myself). We were tasked with creating a feature that would invite more folks of different backgrounds to participate in news discussion. My team ended up tackling this by creating the Q&A platform which directly solicited the opinions of readers by asking questions based off of article text analysis and user reading history. Ultimately, the reason it's my favorite project thus far is because we had all recognized how important being able to increase diversity of the user base was just from our personal backgrounds and because I could relate to my team members better, I wasn't afraid of brainstorming any idea, regardless of how ludicrous.

Attending Meetups, obsessing over the latest and greatest productivity/coding tools (via Product Hunt mostly), questioning Quora, discovering a song on Spotify and repeating it over and over till I get sick of it, blogging/writing/reading, watching movies in an actual theater (vintage, I know), micro-managing my online presence, and cuddling with my boyfriend. I also have quite a "panache" for design.

I try to update my website as much as possible with my projects so feel free to explore that as much as you can to get a better idea of who I am as a person and not just a student or developer. I'm active on a lot of different websites and for an idea of that, you're welcome to check out my Gravatar at http://gravatar.com/fvcproductions. Cheers!
