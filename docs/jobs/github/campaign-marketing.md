# **Dear Recruiter**

This letter is to express my interest in your **Campaign Marketing Intern** position.

Some background - I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at [Cornell Tech](http://tech.cornell.edu) in New York City, having received a Bachelor’s in Computer Science prior.

I’m interested in GitHub because the company and I both care about the same thing — well-designed products. The design of a product is something I’ve recognized early on as a competitive advantage across all kinds of disruptive technologies. It can truly [**make or break**](http://designdisruptors.com) a product.

This role also ties in with my goal of wanting to be able to work for a company where I genuinely enjoy using the product and believe in the product going forward in the future. Both is true with GitHub.

In your listing, you mentioned that the qualifications for this role would include an **aptitude for design** and **experience marketing or launching products** or side projects.

As a designer, I have received very good feedback on my work done with Sketch and Keynote for rapid prototyping and presentation designs. As a developer, my background includes internships involving web design and development using HTML/CSS/JS and optimizing the UI for Unity applications.

My side projects have also received lots of traction in the past - like with my Jeopardy template which has gotten over 16K hits across the web or with the design interfaces I've published onto my Behance which have gotten almost 5K views overall.

Through your internship, I hope to gain a lot more experience as both designer and content marketer.

Feel free to refer to my portfolio links for more examples of my product and design work.

#### I look forward to hearing back!

**Sincerely,**
**Frances Coronel**
