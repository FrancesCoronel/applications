# Dear Recruiter

This letter is to express my interest in your **Web Designer** position.

Some background - Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at [Cornell Tech](http://tech.cornell.edu) in New York City, having received a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science prior.

Iâ€™m interested in GitHub because it ties in with my goal of wanting to be able to work for a company where I genuinely enjoy using the product and believe in the product going forward in the future. Both is true with GitHub.

In your listing, you mentioned a couple of qualifications:

- portfolio that demonstrates examples of thoughtful and well-executed design, including the HTML & CSS that brings your design to life in the browser & experience with designing and building responsive, mobile-first web pages

> You can view my portfolio at [fvcproductions.com/portfolio](http://fvcproductions.com/portfolio) which includes a wide array of web projects that aim to be mobile-friendly.

- ability to present your work, as well as articulate and receive written and verbal feedback

> I try to provide well-formed documentation for all my small side projects.

- comfortable working in a remote-friendly environment where communication and collaboration are frequently asynchronous

> I was one of the few folks to complete an online [Designlab course on designing for the web](https://fvcproductions.com/2015/10/21/my-designlab-experience/).

- sense of humor and egoless ownership of projects. ðŸ˜‚

> You'll find that a lot of my commits and documentation for small projects involves pictures and emojii.

- ability to estimate, balance, and adhere to timelines.

> I'm a neat kind of freak so calendars and lists are part of my core code. I also can't stand a messy desk.

- solid understanding of HTML and CSS (including Sass).

> Most of my projects use `HTML`, `JS`, and `Sass` compiled down to `CSS`.

- experience with Git and GitHub workflows

> I've had a GitHub account ([`fvcproductions`](http://github.com/fvcproductions)) since I graduated high school in 2013 and have been a fairly active user.

Through this role, I hope to gain a lot more development and design experience.

Feel free to refer to my portfolio links for more examples of my work.

#### I look forward to hearing back!

**Sincerely,**
**Frances Coronel**
