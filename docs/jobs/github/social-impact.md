# Dear Recruiter

This letter is to express my interest in your **Social Impact Program Coordinator Intern** position.

Some background - I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at [Cornell Tech](http://tech.cornell.edu) in New York City, having received a Bachelor’s in Computer Science prior.

I’m interested in GitHub because it ties in with my goal of wanting to be able to work for a company where I genuinely enjoy using the product and believe in the product going forward in the future. Both is true with GitHub.

In your listing, you mentioned a couple of qualifications that would fit for this role:

- familiarity with GitHub

> I've had a GitHub account ([`fvcproductions`](http://github.com/fvcproductions)) since I graduated high school in 2013 and have been a fairly active user.

- familiarity with open source

> I've contributed to a few open-source repos.

- an understanding of or experience with non-profits

> I volunteered with non-profits a lot when I was younger and became a leader for my [Operation Smile](http://operationsmile.com) high school club, participating in international conferences and medical missions.

- basic web-page building skills

> I love building for the web! You can see [my portfolio](http://fvcproductions.com/portfolio) for proof.

- proficiency with building and maintaining spreadsheets, Google forms

> This sort of project management was present in all the group projects I've been a part of since I tended to take the initiative and become the productivity guru.

- experience with using social media to connect with community

> A lot of folks on my LinkedIn profile can vouch for my social media skills that I've used to market myself to potential clients and employers.

Through your internship, I hope to gain a lot more experience in open-source and in project management.

Feel free to refer to my portfolio links for more examples of my work.

#### I look forward to hearing back!

**Sincerely,**
**Frances Coronel**
