At the start of my life, I’d thought I’d be pursuing a career in biology which then refocused to zoology, which then shifted to bioinformatics, which ultimately led to my love of computer science, specifically in AI. I’ve always been a STEM sort of person.

Consequently, I’m currently majoring in Computer Science at Hampton University, but I am more interested specifically in machine learning within the area of artificial intelligence due to it’s multi-dimensionality and untapped potential services for humanity.

I'm aiming now to become a software engineer that utilizes advanced AI and machine learning based algorithms. I'd say you can't go wrong with AI if the ultimate goal is just to establish a career as a serious programmer who likes to dabble with the undiscovered.

Naturally, most undergraduates will not be ready to tackle the advanced algorithms necessary to create that high level of software, so I’ll need a Ph.D first if I want to be tackle those sort of problems. I’d be interested in writing the software for robots that could work side by side with workers in the health care industry, laboratories, and factories.

However, my undergraduate degree is already seeming to take deep financial tolls. I need to be able to feel secure while pursuing my higher education, both mentally and financially. Being awarded this scholarship would help me reach my goal of becoming a game changer in AI for my school, my community, and hopefully, the world.
