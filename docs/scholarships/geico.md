> What have I done academically and in my activities to deserve a GEICO achievement award?

In an ideal future, I hope to be able to apply my knowledge of biological research techniques in combination with the advanced use of artificial intelligence (specifically within the realm of genetic algorithms) in the hope of positively benefiting humanity. In the words of the fictional character Peter Weyland, “We [will be able to] create cybernetic individuals who in just a few short years will be completely indistinguishable from us”. I merely want to speed along that indistinguishableness.

In seeking to attain this major goal, I have already tackled various intellectual challenges. At the age of 10, I began my first high school courses with Algebra 1. At 13, my first college courses took place at Tidewater Community College (TCC) during the summer of my freshman year. At 15, my first university course was General Zoology at Hampton University during the summer of my sophomore year. During high school, I took 10 AP courses, not including the numerous dual enrollment courses taken at numerous institutions. I returned to TCC in the summer of my senior year and took 4 courses, auditing one. The past two summers, I have taken formal courses and Hampton and Old Dominion University so that I may graduate a year early. With so much experience in formal academia, there was a shift from the traditional this past summer when I was accepted and generously given a large scholarship to attend the intensive coding bootcamp Fullstack Academy, which has an 8% acceptance rate and aims to prepare students to become leaders in the tech industry and not just followers.

Indeed, my prior academic history will tell you I’ve always tried to pursue things earlier and constantly involve myself with the non-familiar. I entered primary school earlier, took numerous college classes earlier through dual enrollment while still in high school, volunteered internationally at a relatively young age, studied wildlife research abroad with college students while I was still in high school, ended up graduating high school at the top of my class at an age younger than the majority, and am now able to graduate one year earlier from college at the age of 20. I have pursued all these scholarly and extracurricular ventures in the past (and continue to) because I am genuinely interested in what I pursue. For me, it is not the rush, but the thrill of the experiences that I’ve gone through that makes me pursue them in the first place.

Naturally, however, I will not be ready to tackle the kind of challenges that AI will present in the future with just a Bachelor’s degree, so I’m looking forward to getting my Master’s in Computer Science following graduation and then entering the industry.

Outside of formal academic pursuits, I am the Website Committee Chair of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Student Chapter at Hampton and am in charge of the ACM website, related social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, GitHub), and organization branding. Recently, I acted as a student volunteer/scholarship recipient for the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Conference in January 2015. Later, in February 2015, Google sponsored me to attend the annual ACM Richard Tapia Conference in Boston, which aims at promoting diversity in computing. I comprehend this moment more than ever that the so-called “perfect storm” has only become more prominent in communities like mine, where the minority will soon become the majority by 2043 and will be given the responsibility, inevitably, to lead a multitude of tech companies nationally. We will become the movers and the shakers, but first, we will have to resolve the issue of accessibility. Conferences like Richard Tapia’s are essential in order for that accessibility to become decoded and ultimately resolved.

In the words of TED speaker and the current Chairman of Dreamworks Animation, Mellody Hobson, if we mean to solve a very difficult problem, we’re going to need a manifold of intellects, ergo, a diverse group of people involved. Hobson calls for “color bravery”, and I believe this GEM Fellowship aspires to do just that. It exposes to students like me an opportunity to work with the brightest tech companies so that not only can my assumptions in computing can be challenged and extended, but so that I may also inclusively grow as a human being.

I maintain various virtual portfolios that can better showcase my projects and through my blog, I am open with each and every experience I’ve gone through and how they've helped me grow as an individual.

For those that know me, they know my ambition is undefined - that I will pursue anything I believe I have rightfully earned, and because of this and the reasoning I have described, I believe I could greatly benefit from the GEM Fellowship.

In my experience, it is usually after companies have thoroughly reviewed my online work and profiles that I have received offers.

I encourage the GEM Fellowship Committee to do the same as I have shared a very limited amount of my experience and adventures in the realm of computer science in this online application.

You will not regret it.
