Well, I'm already planning on attending a bootcamp in front-end development the summer of 2015 (hopefully in San Francisco, fingers crossed!), and because I've become so vested in being accepted into a genuinely awesome bootcamp that has a high ROI, I've made sure to keep up with the latest news through CourseReport, which (surprise, surprise) is where I found out about Code Camp! 

So just being able to actually get at least some experience in what I intend to completely focus on for a full 3 months and from what I've gathered from external websites besides Square's, the experience Code Camp has to offer will not only help me grow as a future developer, but it'll also be a pretty amazing few days.

Also, I'd like to point out that there's this observation out there that some have dubbed as "The Perfect Storm" and basically it's talking about how by the year 2040 (roughly speaking), that half of the US will be compromised of minorities. Now this is an issue because by that point, the biggest factors demographically will be the growing populations of older folks and minorities. These two big factors could really blow up in our faces and create some kind of perfect political storm or even perhaps a grand sectarianism that will reduce productivity in the country as a whole. 

 Now personally, I don't think it has to end up that way. It should't end up that way. And I believe part of the solution to this perfect storm is making sure all organization in the US reform their agendas so that they appeal to broader segments of the population. Thankfully, Code Camp is already one of those organizations that's taking that vital step for the inevitable better position women will have in the tech field. I simply want to be part of that step.
