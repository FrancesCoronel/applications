### The Women in Leadership program will support the leadership development of women across the Bay Area, establish a pipeline for professional advancement, and create a cross-sector network of women who support each otherâ€™s career growth. How do you see yourself benefitting from this experience?

The Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations. And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Latinas and Black women holding only 1% and 3% of computing jobs, respectively.

So what can one conclude from all this?

Well, first, let me provide some context.

A unicorn is a startup company (like Slack) valued at over $1 billion. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about 1.28% likely to happen).

This means that according to those standards, I'm quite literally a "unicorn" in the sense that I'm part of the 1% of Latinas that considers herself a die-hard software engineer.

Now I became aware of this isolation so long ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who want to enter the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in.

But to truly break down this stereotype, we need to have more Latinas pursuing tech careers. With this program I'm hoping to not only learn how to become a better leader but ultimately, my goal lies in getting to the point where I can inspire others on a massive scale who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead in the tech industry. In any industry, really.

### What life experiences and skill sets will you contribute to the cohort?

I've gotten paid to write code since 2013 through freelancing and I've been a professional software engineer since 2015 and specialize in UI/front end development. Currently, I'm a front end engineer at Slack which is the one of the fastest growing tech startups in the world.

I've explored many facets of the tech industry - as an IC at small and large companies, open-source backer/contributor/maintainer, a CS student and even as a finalist for Kapor Capital's summer associate program despite having no prior experience in business or venture capital.

Outside of work, I enjoy mentoring others new to the industry and speaking across the country at tech conferences. I've attended over 45 so far since 2011 and have spoken over 20 times at events since 2012.

And finally in terms of academic background, I have both a Bachelor's (Hampton) & Master's in Computer Science (Cornell).

Since having graduated with an MS in CS from Cornell Tech, I've taken a total of 89 college-level courses starting from 2010. To provide context, that's about 30% more than the average master's student will take, including undergrad courses.

I was awarded a generous merit scholarship to attend Cornell Tech where I graduated Cum Laude. I was the only Latina in my class. I was also awarded a full-ride merit scholarship to attend Hampton University where I graduated as valedictorian of the CS department in just 2.5 years.

My personal website has gotten over 150K views since 2013.

### How do you envision the program helping you advance in your career and/or life? In what areas (if any) of your career and/or life are you feeling stuck?

I hope this program will set me up to become a leader and I would like to work on driving change without explicit authority and from a place of sympathy. I would also like to work on asserting myself in a space and communicating more effectively to a large group of people.

### What are you most passionate about?

I've been involved with all aspects of open source development - maintainer, contributor, backer, organization lead, etc - it's been a huge passion of mine for quite some time.

I also enjoy mentoring on how to prepare for coding bootcamps but I have teachable experience in web development, web design, and all sorts of nifty dev, design, or productivity tools.

### Limited tuition assistance is available to program participants. If you would like to apply, for what reasons should you be considered for the scholarship?

I have a stipend that I can use on professional development every year from my company. However, even with that stipend, the cost of the program is not entirely covered.
