## Why do you want to mentor?

It's actually very selfishly satisfying to me when I volunteer my time towards mentoring others who are also interested in the tech field which is something I've been doing since 2015.

Generally speaking, I enjoy mentoring on how to prepare for coding bootcamps but I have teachable experience in web development, web design, and the tech industry in general.

In terms of preparation for coding bootcamps, I’ve helped out folks who have successfully gone on to coding bootcamps like Fullstack Academy, Hack Reactor, and MakerSquare.

I’ve also tutored kids at the elementary, middle, and high school level on how to get started in the tech field through the organization Code.org and female college students through the organization Women in Technology and Entrepreneurship in New York (WiTNY) in collaboration with Cornell Tech.

Since January 2015, I’ve dedicated over 50 hours of my free time (not including training and travel) mentoring awesome people who just want to learn more about how to get started as a software developer.

You can even find feedback from my mentoring sessions on my website: https://fvcproductions.com/services and https://fvcproductions.com/services/mentoring/
