## Background

> Our goal is to have a diverse group of workshop conductors representing different backgrounds, life experiences, skill levels, and perspectives. Tell us a bit about your background and experience, and how it might contribute to the diversity of viewpoints weâ€™re aiming for

The Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations. And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Latinas and Black women holding only 1% and 3% of computing jobs, respectively.

So what can one conclude from all this?

Well, first, let me provide some context.

A unicorn is a startup company valued at over a billion dollars. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about 1.28% likely to happen).

This means that according to those standards, I'm quite literally a "unicorn" in the sense that I'm part of the 1% of Latinas that considers herself a die-hard software engineer.

Now I became aware of this isolation so long ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who want to enter the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in.

By speaking at Codeland, I'm hoping to not only help others solidify their skills in the latest and greatest in web development standards but ultimately, my goal lies in becoming a leader in the field in order to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead in the tech industry. In any industry, really.

## Workshop Goal

> How would you describe your goal for attendees of this workshop? What do you want them to walk away with, and how do you see this adding value to them as coders?

I want to talk about Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) because they allow web apps to take advantage of all the positives that a native mobile app offers like offline support and push notifications and brings it to the mobile website experience.

PWAs are Google-backed, steadily becoming mainstream (a famous example being Twitter Lite with the new level of quality allowing the web app to earn their place on a user's home screen just like a mobile app.

I think PWAs would be a great topic to learn for a developer at any stage of their careers since it promotes many positive accessibility practices and is quickly becoming the next golden web standard.

It will allow attendees to differentiate themselves for their next career opportunity by showing they can grasp the fundamentals of this new standard in delivering amazing user experiences on the web.

## What will attendees make?

> It's important that attendees walk away with something tangible. What will attendees make during your workshop? If they're following an existing tutorial, please include a link to that tutorial. Otherwise, please submit in as much detail as possible what steps attendees will go through to complete this project.

The main goal of the workshop will be to make sure attendees can walk away knowing how to go from 0 to 100 on the Progressive Web App (PWA) score using Lighthouse. This shows that they understand what core elements are needed to transform an ordinary looking website into a PWA.

There are three key parts that will form the workshop:

1. a high-level overview of PWAs and the benefits they provide

I will show screenshots and real-life examples of well-known companies (not just tech companies either) that are implementing PWAs and explore the benefits these companies have reaped by doing so.

I want to make sure the audience understands how seriously top companies are implementing PWAs for their major products and how they themselves can benefit career-wise from being more aware of these newer standards.

2. showing how to get a 100% PWA audit score by testing a pre-existing website on Lighthouse with attendees adding in the necessary components

Lighthouse can be run through Chrome DevTools and provides audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.

Lighthouse has 4 criterion that it evaluates - Progressive Web App, Performance, Accessibility and Best Practices.

Attendees will be using a pre-existing website built with Hugo, a static site generator, that already has 3 of the 4 criteria completed with the goal of the workshop being to bring the 4th criteria of "Progressive Web App" to a 100% score.

To make it a bit more fun, the pre-existing website that we will be using is the personal website for the fictional professor "Annalise Keating" from the popular TV show "How to Get Away With Murder". It uses the popular Hugo Academic theme and will already be available for attendees to fork from GitHub and start working on.

> For reference, Annalise Keating's bio can be found here: http://howtogetawaywithmurder.wikia.com/wiki/Annalise_Keating

The attendees will then be walked through adding the necessary modules for the PWA score which will involve adding in a manifest, service workers, app icons and enabling HTTPs.

Each step will come with code samples and plenty of screenshots. As each necessary PWA module is added, attendees will see the score steadily rise up until is at a full 100%. Satisfaction achieved!

By the end of this, each attendee will have a fully deployed PWA through GitHub pages to showcase to friends or even potential employers.

3. reviewing key concepts on what was needed to build a PWA and opportunities attendees can look into for future development and learning

After going through the process of making an existing website PWA friendly, we will review the concepts we've covered and talk about resources and opportunities attendees can look into to further develop and learn about Google's new PWA standard.

## Introduction to Topic

> It's important for attendees to have some background info on the workshop topic before getting started on a project. What background info do you plan to present? Think of this as a short 5-10 min talk to give people context before diving in. Please provide as much detail as possible.

Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs for short, are a fairly new and evolving concept that is Google-backed and on its way to becoming the new golden web standard. What makes PWAs so special is that they're just ordinary looking websites but they also have the ability to function as a native mobile app would.

You see, native mobile apps you'd normally install from the app store can do things like sending push notifications, work offline, load from the home screen, and so on and so forth. By comparison, mobile-friendly websites accessed in a mobile browser still don't have the capacity to do any of these things.

Progressive Web Apps fix that issue by bringing features we expect from native apps to the mobile browser experience. This means that if a website becomes a PWA, it is using features such as web push notifications and service workers to mimic the same interaction a native mobile app would offer.

In other words, PWAs attempt to combine features offered by most modern browsers with the benefits of the mobile experience. A user can finally get the best of both worlds with the reliability and engagement a native app can provide combined with the performance and lightweight architecture a web app can offer.

Although it may seem quite difficult to implement a PWA, the key technical aspects only involve HTTPS, service workers, and a web app manifest. This implies as long as you serve your site over HTTPS, you have a service worker with some basic caching, and you register a web app manifest with some basic information like the name and at least one icon, your website is recognized as a PWA.

In this workshop, I'll walk you through the steps on transforming an existing website into a PWA from the bottom up and together, we'll explore the wide array of companies that have already benefited from the many enhancements that PWAs offer.

## Fit

> Why are you the right person to conduct this workshop? This is less about expertise (which is not a requirement), and more about the relationship between the topic and the workshop conductor, and finding a good fit. Feel free to include your passion, past experience, previous roles, etc.

I've been in love with the web throughout my academic and professional career. I love the web because, unlike other platforms, the web is the most accessible and easy to build upon. Although the radio has served as the most accessible form of information ever since its origination, I believe the web can and will surpass the radio in both reach and value.

I've built 2 PWAs all on my own with my own website scoring a 91% for the PWA score and have completed almost all of the PWA related online code labs available through Google.

I've even attended the PWA Roadshow and the Chrome Dev Summit by Google this year in San Francisco which both allowed me to understand how PWAs work at a higher level.

In terms of prior speaking experience, I've given technical talks over 10 times so far on web design, coding bootcamps, TypeScript and how to get started in the tech field. I've given these talks not just at conferences but at hackathons and Meetups as well.

In all honesty, speaking didn't initially start as a big passion of mine as I would get terribly nervous and sweat profusely. However, I learned to love even the jitters because it makes up for when audience members come to me afterward and tell me they got something valuable out of my talk. That positive feedback has made all the difference.

And although this would be my first technical workshop, I believe I have the right amount of passion and engineering background to be able to inspire others to love the web just a little bit more through PWAs.
