# Women Who Code + Bradfield School of Computer Science

## Background

Frances Coronel is a developer with a design background who gets a lot of personal satisfaction out of helping the local tech community through her varied skill set.

She is currently a Software Engineer at Accenture's Liquid Studio, having previously interned at the Liquid Studio as an AR/VR developer.

She has a Master's in Computer Science from Cornell Tech and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Hampton University.

## What would you like to accomplish over the next 5-10 years?

My short-term goals involve contributing to open-source projects and speaking at technical conferences much more often.

In the long-term, I want to be able to help engineer and invest in alternative forms of education for computer science and become a leader in that community.

By that time, I will have also become a leader in the field I'm passionate about which is developer advocacy right now but that could very well change.

Ultimately, I want to feel more confident in taking a CTO like role after such a time.

## How has Women Who Code impacted your career, and why is it important to you?

Women Who Code has impacted my career by offering me the opportunity to take advantage of all the resources and events they offer that I would have not have otherwise heard of and been able to attend.

I attended one of my first conferences of all women (Sally Conference) because of the Women Who Code network two years ago.

I won honorable mention at a hackathon WWCode organized in San Jose at PayPal just last year.

And this year, I was awarded a ticket to attend Startup Grind which is a conference I've been wanting to attend for over a year. I even blogged about my experience!

I will also be speaking at the WE Rise Tech Conference in Atlanta, GA this upcoming June since my "TypeScript 101" talk was accepted and that conference is organized by Women Who Code Atlanta.

Women Who Code is very important to me because I don't have a very powerful network filled with Stanford or Harvard CS grads so having organizations like Women Who Code support me by sharing resources is amazing and I know I'm going to keep taking part in WWC events for a long time to come.
