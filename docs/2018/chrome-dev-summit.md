# Chrome Dev Summit

## Please describe why you are interested in attending the Chrome Dev Summit?

Well, as a budding software engineer focused on UI development, the Chrome Dev Summit directly addresses the tools and topics I want to develop my skills in. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skill set whenever necessary - i.e. back in 2015, I was all about the MEAN stack and nowadays I'm not using any of those technologies.

Some folks would get bothered by the constant change but it's honestly what I love most about the work I do and I actually think it's great how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time. Through the power of service workers, PWAs and Chrome Dev Tools (naturally), I want to be able to explore how I can make my web apps scale even better both in the workplace and through my open-source contributions. Such feats would really set on my right path to what I hope will be a long career as a software engineer for the web.

Also, just in general, I'm a HUGE fan of PWAs - I've given various talks on how to implement them at conferences & Meetups:

## Given your personal background, describe an experience that illustrates the importance of diversity to you. \*

The Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations. And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Latinas and Black women holding only 1% and 3% of computing jobs, respectively.

So what can one conclude from all this?

Well, first, let me provide some context.

A unicorn is a startup company (like Slack where I work) valued at over $1 billion. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about 1.28% likely to happen).

This means that according to those standards, I’m rarer than a “unicorn” in the sense that I’m part of the 1% of women in tech that considers herself a die-hard software engineer and identifies as Latina.

Now as I mentioned prior, I became aware of this isolation a long time ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who wish to enter the tech field but may not feel like they’ll fit in.

Ultimately, my goal lies in becoming a leader in the field in other to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead in the tech industry. In any industry, really.

## Are you currently (or planning to be) a web developer? For web developers, what projects or products are you working on? \*

I’m currently a full-time software engineer on the Customer Acquisition team at Slack (a collaboration hub for teams) at their headquarters in San Francisco where my mission is to make your working life more straightforward, more pleasant and more productive.

My team is basically the Moby Dicks of the engineering org at Slack as we try to catch the biggest whales or biggest customers. I work on a lot of the public facing web material for Slack like https://slack.com (our main website) or https://slackhq.com (our blog). The idea is to attract the next millions of customers that don't know anything about Slack but could really benefit from it.

I also work as an open source developer for Techqueria which is one of the largest groups for Latinx in tech. I feel as though working on open source projects that I'm personally connected to really allows me to stay on top of my game while enjoying myself too.

## What are your biggest pain points on the web today? What are you most excited about for the future of the web?

Biggest pain points: too many golden standards, how easy it is to bloat up a simple web page now, being over shined by ML development, ML researchers consistently trying to tell me that the web will be created by robots in the future (boo).

Excited about: our strive towards better standards across all web browsers, the web replacing all operating systems, PWAs over native mobile apps, blazing fast performance tooling.

## If you could ask the Chrome team one question, what would it be?

How can I become a Google Developer Expert for PWAs or what would be the most ideal way to start on that track?
