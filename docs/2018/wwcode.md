Very much so.

I attended one of my first conferences of all women because of the Women Who Code network two years ago.

I've won honorable mention at a hackathon WWCode organized in San Jose just last year.

And this year, I was awarded a ticket to attend Startup Grind which is a conference I've been wanting to attend for over a year.

I don't have a very powerful network filled with Stanford or Harvard CS grads so having organizations like Women Who Code support me by sharing resources is amazing and I know I'm going to keep taking part in WWC events for a long time to come.
