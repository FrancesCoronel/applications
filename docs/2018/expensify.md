# Expensify

## What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?

You can find my website at [https://fvcproductions.com](https://fvcproductions.com/).

## What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?

I was actually initially interested in bio-informatics most of my high school career. My junior year of high school (2012), however, I figured why don’t I just major in computer science? It’s the other half of bio-informatics that I have little to no experience in. And once I finished my degree in CS, I could still do on to work in bio-informatics. It was a win, win!

...But by the end of my junior year of high school, I got a lot more vested in the CS aspect and I haven't really looked back since. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

My first formal CS class covered the fundamentals of C++ in summer 2013 at a local community college.

Later, I decided to study CS abroad for a semester in Germany and took formal courses in Python and Java.

I transferred to Hampton University to continue my studies in CS afterward and started taking more programming courses, becoming formally exposed to C, C++, Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, and Android development with Java.

I attended Fullstack Academy in the summer of 2015 and was taught the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js).

After Fullstack Academy, I started working professionally as a developer at 80|20 Software Consulting, which I was able to get shortly after graduating from Fullstack.

Even though most of the projects were client based, I ended up working on an internal platform using HTML/CSS/JS and AngularJS that targeted clients who couldn’t afford the regular cost of our services and would be okay with a more automated way of maintaining their website instead. Within that role, I also consulted a few folks on their Wordpress websites.

I only ended up working at 80|20 for a few months before realizing it was interfering too much with my schooling as I was finishing my last semester of undergrad and had to complete several research projects that I didn’t enjoy very much at all.

I ended up receiving a full-time offer to work at Accenture as a technical consultant in SF upon graduating from Hampton in May 2016 but I turned it down and went with an internship instead since I decided to myself that I needed to learn some more and get a Master’s in CS too. I was also younger than the average college grad (20) and I didn’t feel it was necessary to enter the workforce immediately.

At that internship, Accenture placed me in their Redwood City office which was pretty hip and “lean”. There, I was part of the very small wearables team where I worked on optimizing Unity applications to impress clients. I didn’t have any experience with Unity or consumer hardware before but I was surprised I learned as fast as I did.

The main tools/languages I used throughout my internship were Unity (C# and JS are used to create scripts), Sketch, Android Studio, Xcode, and Safari for Developers. I also helped the onboarding team create documentation in order to prepare incoming developers on the basics of Unity and all the hardware available.

Accenture offered me a full-time offer once again following the internship but alas, I turned it down already because I felt the company wasn't really for me.

In December 2016, I took on a role as ambassador for Fullstack Academy, the program I mentioned earlier. It is similar to being a dev evangelist but it doesn’t really require any technical acumen. Just a lot of passion for Fullstack and what it offers.

In June of 2017, I started a full-time position with Accenture as a Software Engineer at the Liquid Studio in Redwood City, CA.

I've recently supplemented my work by mentoring students part-time through Thinkful's online Flexible Web Development Bootcamp since last month.

It’s pretty clear that my experience thus far has been mostly with larger corporations. I’m expecting this to change.

## What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?

In the long-term (5 to 10 years from now), I want to be able to help engineer and invest in alternative forms of education for computer science and become a leader in that community.

If we're talking about the rest of my life (at least career-wise), I want what most folks want - work that I'm happy to wake up and go to every day and that makes me feel I'm actually making some kind of positive impact on the world.

I want to feel challenged but I feel like my role at my company right now is very narrow and doesn't allow for a lot of flexibility or multiple "hat wearing", per se. I know I can do so much more than just develop products but even with my current project, I don't go beyond doing basic dev work and tutorials.

My current company is also very large so it's easy to feel more like a "resource" than anything else. By joining Expensify, I'm hoping I'll be able to actually cultivate a more meaningful relationship with not just the work I'm doing but with my team.

## How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.

[I heard the CEO speak at Startup Grind](https://fvcproductions.com/2018/02/14/startup-grind/#good-intentions-bad-advice-how-to-keep-your-board-aligned-with-your-vision) and he was pretty impressive so I figured I would look into it.
