## Nordic.js

### Why should you get a Diversity Ticket?

To answer the earlier question:

Well, as a budding software engineer focused on UI development, Nordic.js directly addresses the tools and topics I want to develop my skills in. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skill set whenever necessary - i.e. back in 2015, I was all about the MEAN stack and nowadays I'm not using any of those technologies.

Some folks would get bothered by the constant change but it's honestly what I love most about the work I do and I actually think it's great how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time. Through the power of JavaScript, I want to be able to explore how I can make my web apps both in my workplace and through my open-source contributions scale even better. I believe such a feat would really set on my right path to a great start to what I hope will be a long career in the tech industry.

Also, just in general, I'm a HUGE fan of JavaScript - I've given various talks related to JavaScript and its super set TypeScript at conferences, Meetups & hackathons: https://www.fvcproductions.com/speaking/

However, if none of that has convinced you of my passion for JS, I will end with one last point.

...

The Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations. And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Latinas and Black women holding only 1% and 3% of computing jobs, respectively.

So what can one conclude from all this?

Well, first, let me provide some context.

A unicorn is a startup company (like Slack which is where I work) valued at over $1 billion. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about 1.28% likely to happen).

This means that according to those standards, I'm quite literally a "unicorn" in the sense that I'm part of the 1% of Latinas that considers herself a die-hard software engineer.

Now I became aware of this isolation so long ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who want to enter the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in.

With this conference, I'm hoping to not only learn the latest and greatest in web development standards using JavaScript but ultimately, my goal lies in becoming a leader in the field in other to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead in the tech industry. In any industry, really.
