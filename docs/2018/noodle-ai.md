## What is one thing you are passionate about?

I love Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) because they allow web apps to take advantage of all the positives that a native mobile app offers like offline support and push notifications and brings it to the mobile website experience.

PWAs are Google-backed, steadily becoming mainstream (a famous example being Twitter Lite with the new level of quality allowing the web app to earn their place on a user's home screen just like a mobile app.

I think PWAs would be a great topic to learn for a developer at any stage of their careers since it promotes many positive accessibility practices and is quickly becoming the next golden web standard.
