So as you are most likely aware, JavaScript is expanding its footprint every day and it is both overwhelming and amazing what you can do with the language nowadays.

However, as more large-scale projects start to use JavaScript, the process of making the code easier to write and more maintainable becomes more and more difficult.

This is a problem Microsoft recognized early on and they came up with the solution of TypeScript and released the first version about 6 years ago.

In essence, TypeScript trying to help JavaScript reach new heights and become very scalable.

In this class, I'll be covering the basics on how to transition from JavaScript to TypeScript to more advanced topics like real life applications of how TypeScript is being used to scale projects in innovative new ways.

By the end of this class, the audience will have a better understanding of why so many powerful tech companies have embraced TypeScript over JavaScript and what resources they can take advantage of to start being able to embrace it as well.

Well, as a budding software engineer, The Lead Developer directly addresses the tools and topics I want to develop my skills in. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skill set whenever necessary. It's what I love most about the work I do - the constant change of it all and how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time.

With this conference, I'm hoping to not only learn the latest and greatest developments within the web community but I also hope to be able to meet developers and leads smarter than I am who are friendly and as open as the teams and projects they maintain. The people are what it's all about in the end after all.
