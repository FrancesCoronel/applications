# CircleCI

## Blog posts you’ve written

All blog posts I've written can be found on my [website](https://fvcproductions.com/blog).

## Speaker decks or videos of talks you’ve given

You can see all the presentations I've given on my [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/FVCproductions) profile.

I used to maintain a [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions) profile as well but it seems GitHub isn't that interested in developing that platform further.

## Open source projects you contribute to

Overall, I've gotten over 100 stars on all the GitHub repos that I've maintained which I recognize isn't that many in the grand scheme of things but this is on top of everything else I enjoy doing.

I'm actually a key contributor/maintainer for [freeCodeCamp/guides](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guides/graphs/contributors).

The `freeCodeCamp/guides` repo is special in the sense that it's probably the most accessible on GitHub to make a PR for. It has ~3K open PRs from mostly folks new to open-source development and ~5K PRs have already been merged.

I also maintain [hire-me](https://hire-me.launchaco.com/) which has been featured as an awesome [Docsify](https://github.com/QingWei-Li/awesome-docsify) (static site documentation generator) project.

And I don't just contribute to open-source, I sponsor projects too! I love using Docsify so much that I recently [became their first sponsor](https://opencollective.com/fvcproductions#about) through Open Collective.

## Community groups you organize

I helped out with the ACM club un undergrad but beyond that, I haven't been the founder/organizer of any Meetup groups or anything like that.

I will say though that it's extremely rare to find someone of my background (Latina) who enjoys going to hackathons and conferences so much. Since 2011, I've attended over 40 different tech events with plans to attend 6 more within the first 3 months of 2018.

## Hackathons you’ve organized

I helped with website development/design/marketing for ODU's [Monarchs Hack the Campus](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~acm/hackathon/).

This year, I'm the head organizer for an Earth Day themed hackathon that will be be hosted at my company and aims to help underrepresented high school students better understand the design thinking process.
