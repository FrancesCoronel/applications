## Title

TypeScript 101

## Elevator Pitch

This class aims to introduce the benefits TypeScript provides to large-scale JavaScript projects.

As your professor, I will be covering the differences between TypeScript and JavaScript, how TypeScript suddenly became the cool kid, and of course, I’ll be assigning homework at the end (wink wink).

## Description

So as you are most likely aware, JavaScript is expanding its footprint every day and it is both overwhelming and amazing what you can do with the language nowadays.

However, as more large-scale projects start to use JavaScript, the process of making the code easier to write and more maintainable becomes more and more difficult.

This is a problem Microsoft recognized early on and they came up with the solution of TypeScript and released the first version about 6 years ago.

In essence, TypeScript trying to help JavaScript reach new heights and become very scalable.

In this class, I'll be covering the basics on how to transition from JavaScript to TypeScript to more advanced topics like real life applications of how TypeScript is being used to scale projects in innovative new ways.

By the end of this class, you'll understand why so many powerful tech companies have embraced TypeScript over JavaScript and what resources you can take advantage to start being able to embrace it as well.

## Bio

Frances is a developer with a design background who gets a lot of personal satisfaction out of helping the local tech community through her varied skill set.

Frances currently works as a Software Engineer at Accenture's Liquid Studio in Silicon Valley, specializing in UI engineering.

She has a Master's in Computer Science from Cornell Tech and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Hampton University.

In the long-term, she wants to be able to help engineer and invest in alternative forms of education for computer science and become a leader in that community.

Frances is passionate about all aspects of development and regularly contributes to open-source projects while attending conferences, hackathons, and Meetups related to tech.

## Notes

I will just need the ability to project with my laptop. I will be bringing my adapter since my MacBook only supports USB-C. I don't think live coding is effective so there won't be any of that.

I have spoken about this topic before at the Strange Loop conference - see https://www.slideshare.net/FVCproductions/strange-loop-2017-typescript-101-extended.

After I gave that talk, someone from the publishing company "The Pragmatic Bookshelf" actually reached out to me and told me I'd be a great fit for writing a book on TypeScript. Even though I thought it was a brilliant opportunity, I was not interested in writing a technical book since I learn better through working hands-on with projects.
