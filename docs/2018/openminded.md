# Openmind - Mentor Application

## You can join as a mentor for multiple topics (if qualified). Select all the topics that you're interested in mentoring for \*

-   Learn to code (for Beginners)
-   Web development
-   Freelancing

## For each of the topics selected above, what is your background/experience? \*

I've been a professional software engineer since 2015 and specialize in UI/front end development. Currently, I'm a front end engineer at Slack which is the one of the fastest growing tech startups in the world.

I've explored many facets of the tech industry - as an IC at small and large companies, open-source backer/contributor/maintainer, a CS student and even as a finalist for Kapor Capital's summer associate program despite having no prior experience in business or venture capital.

Outside of work, I enjoy mentoring others new to the industry and speaking across the country at tech conferences.

And finally in terms of academic background, I have both a Bachelor's (Hampton) & Master's in Computer Science (Cornell).

## Do you have any past experience teaching / tutoring / mentoring?

I've been a mentor with Thinkful since February of this year but I'm looking for something more flexible and meaningful which is why I'm applying to be an Openmind mentor.

I’ve also tutored kids at the elementary, middle, and high school level on how to get started in the tech field through the organization Code.org and female college students through the organization Women in Technology and Entrepreneurship in New York (WiTNY) in collaboration with Cornell Tech.

## Why do you think you'd make a good Openmind mentor? \*

It's actually very selfishly satisfying to me when I volunteer my time towards mentoring others who are also interested in the tech field which is something I've been doing since 2015.

Generally speaking, I enjoy mentoring on how to prepare for coding bootcamps but I have teachable experience in web development, web design, and the tech industry in general.

Even in terms of preparation for coding bootcamps, I’ve helped out folks who have successfully gone on to coding bootcamps like Fullstack Academy, Hack Reactor, and MakerSquare.

Since January 2015, I’ve dedicated over 50 hours of my free time (not including training and travel) mentoring awesome people who just want to learn more about how to get started as a software developer.
