## Why Spectra?

The Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations. And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Latinas and Black women holding only 1% and 3% of computing jobs, respectively.

So what can one conclude from all this?

Well, first, let me provide some context.

A unicorn is a startup company valued at over $1 billion. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about 1.28% likely to happen).

This means that according to those standards, I'm quite literally a "unicorn" in the sense that I'm part of the 1% of Latinas that considers herself a die-hard software engineer.

Now I became aware of this isolation so long ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who want to enter the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in.

Through Spectra, I'm hoping to not only help organize a hackathon rather to ultimately become a leader in this field in order to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead in the tech industry. In any industry, really.

So really, I just recognize how important it is to expose young women to STEM and convince them to stay in an industry where we are not represented, where we are harassed, where we are not paid the same and where we are not seen as leaders. And organizations like Spectra helps.

## Any ideas?

Yes - two ideas.

1. I think hackathons are great but the end products are never going to be used after that day. And often more experienced CS students know this and make a minimal app prototype from a template they found online that is just enough to win. I think hackathons would be more beneficial to everyone involved if they were focused on whoever can more meaningfully contribute to active open-source projects that will actually be used by someone after the event ends and requires more care and thought. This would also help solidify the Git/GitHub skills for the attendees since most open-source projects are maintained on GitHub.

2. I love how all the current organizers are very active and are able to find and take advantage of all these different opportunities related to dev evangelism, speaking at conferences, going to hackathons, and winning scholarships to go places. However, most people, especially women in tech, don't have that kind of powerful network so it would be ideal if there was a newsletter that Spectra could maintain that would share all these kinds of opportunities that one might have never considered were it not for the help of these vast and powerful networks.
