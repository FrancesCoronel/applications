## Why do I want to work at a startup?

I feel like my role at my company right now is very narrow and doesn't allow for a lot of flexibility or multiple "hat wearing", per se. I know I can do so much more than just develop products but even with my current project, I don't go beyond doing basic dev work and tutorials.

My current company is also very large so it's easy to feel more like a "resource" than anything else. Through a startup, I'm hoping I'll be able to actually cultivate a more meaningful relationship with not just the work I'm doing but with my team.

## What would I like founders to know about me?

So the Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations. And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Latinas and Black women holding only 1% and 3% of computing jobs, respectively.

So what can one conclude from all this?

Well, first, let me provide some context.

A unicorn, as I'm sure you already know, is a startup company valued at over $1 billion. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about 1.28% likely to happen).

This means that according to those standards, I'm quite literally a "unicorn" in the sense that I'm part of the 1% of Latinas that considers herself a die-hard software engineer.

Now I became aware of this isolation so long ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who want to enter the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in.

So with all that being said, I will not settle for a company where it's obvious the team is terribly homogenous in background and I'm not interested in being the only female dev on a team. If you're able to make your startup work with a small team of young privileged males, kudos to you but that environment would NOT bode well for me.
