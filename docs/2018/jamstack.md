# JAMstack Conference

> Applied September 8th
> Conference: Oct 29-30

## Why are you interested in attending JAMstack_conf, and how will it positively contribute to your studies or work?

Well, as a budding software engineer focused on UI development, JAMstack_conf directly addresses the tools and topics I want to develop my skills in. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skill set whenever necessary - i.e. back in 2015, I was all about the MEAN stack and nowadays the NERD stack is more popular.

Some folks would get bothered by the constant change but it's honestly what I love most about the work I do. I think it's great how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time. Through the power of the JAMstack, I want to be able to explore how I can make my web apps both in my workplace and through my open-source contributions become even more flexible and less dependent on bulky infrastructure. I believe such a feat would really set on my right path to a great start to what I hope will be a long career in the tech industry.

Also, just in general, I'm a HUGE fan of the JAMstack - I use Hugo (one of the more popular static site generators as you're probably well aware) and it scores a perfect score of 100 with Lighthouse (except performance which is a 99). See https://fvcproductions.com/colophon.

I even applied to the hackathon happening the weekend prior https://hackathon.freecodecamp.org/ and you can check out the little Gatsby website I made for the hackathon application: http://jamstack-hackathon.fvcproductions.com/.

Attending JAMstack_conf would positively contribute to my career at Slack since we're very focused on improving the reliability and performance of our clients and marketing websites. Learning how to create "more predictable deployments" and "increase our performance" are aspects extremely relevant for my day to day job in maintaining and extending Slack.com as an engineer on the customer acquisition team.
