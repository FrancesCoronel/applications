## Why do you want to attend SIGNAL on a scholarship? \*

The Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations. And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Latinas and Black women holding only 1% and 3% of computing jobs, respectively.

So what can one conclude from all this?

Well, first, let me provide some context.

A unicorn is a startup company (like Slack where I work) valued at over $1 billion. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about 1.28% likely to happen).

This means that according to those standards, I'm quite literally a "unicorn" in the sense that I'm part of the 1% of Latinas that considers herself a die-hard software engineer.

Now I became aware of this isolation so long ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who want to enter the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in.

With SIGNAL, I'm hoping to not only learn the latest and greatest in web development and communication standards, but ultimately, my long-term goal lies in becoming a leader in the field in other to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead in the tech industry. In any industry, really.

## Please share any involvement you have in tech communities?

I'm an open source developer with Techqueria, one of the largest Latinx in tech organizations, and I speak regularly at tech events/Meetups locally and across the US (fvcproductions.com/speaking).

I used to be a technical mentor with Thinkful, a well known online coding bootcamp.

I also volunteer with non-profit organizations that specialize in improving access to the tech industry for those in underrepresented backgrounds (Code2040, The Last Mile, SMASH Academy, Girl Develop It, Out of Office Hours, TechHire Oakland, Code.org, etc).

You can see a full laundry list of organizations I've been involved with on my LinkedIn under the "Volunteering" section: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fvcproductions/.

## What's a tech project that you've worked on that you're proud of?

Hopefully this doesn't come across as arrogant but I really love working with my personal website (https://www.fvcproductions.com).

Most developers find it difficult to maintain all the activity they get involved with in one centralized place like the personal portfolio/website but for me, it's basically addicting and I actually de-stress from working on it.

Since 2013, I've been happily blogging and sharing projects I've worked on through my personal website. It's how I got my first freelance gig and the opportunity to mentor folks remotely as it averages 1.5K views per month which is pretty great for a personal website!

Constantly updating and tweaking my website also allows me to tinker with and implement the latest and greatest trends in web like service workers, web push notifications and offline caching (PWAs). So consequently, my own personal website has a 100% score through Lighthouse (the built-in Chrome Dev Tools audit tool) on all metrics (SEO, Accessibility, Best Practices & Progressive Web App). It has a 98% score for performance.

For example, I recently migrated my personal website from Wordpress to Jekyll and then finally decided upon using the static site generator Hugo with Netlify for hosting/deployments. That process alone was super tedious but I learned so much and never want to use a traditional CMS again!

## What are you hoping to get from your time at SIGNAL?

Well, as a budding software engineer at Slack, Twilio directly addresses the tools and topics I want to develop my skills in. Since I work at Slack, it's imperative I understand the latest and greatest developments within the communication space and how the next generation could look like.
