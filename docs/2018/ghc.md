## Title

Progressive Web Apps 101

## Abstract

In this class, I’ll walk you through the steps of transforming an existing website into a Progressive Web App from the bottom up. Together we’ll also explore the wide array of companies that have already benefited from the many enhancements PWAs offer and I’ll even assign some HW at the end (wink wink).

## Prior Speaking Experience

I've spoken at various conferences, Meetups, and related tech events since 2015. My first ever conference talk was on "Web Design for Developers" and since then I've spoken on topics such as "JS Coding Bootcamps", "So You Want To Be A Wizard", "My Experience with Fullstack Academy", "Why should you pursue a career in coding?", the ACM organization, and the Hour of Code.
