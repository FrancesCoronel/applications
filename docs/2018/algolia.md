## Describe the role in which you see yourself happiest.

Hackathons, conferences, Meetups, blog posts, coding, oh my!

My ideal role would involve wearing a lot of hats and being able to get paid for what I enjoy doing outside of work right now. I take the time to attend all these type of events and also contribute to open-source projects but it's hard to do that as much as I would like - hence why I'm applying for this dev evangelist role.

I feel like my role at my company right now is very narrow and doesn't allow for a lot of flexibility or multiple "hat wearing", per se. I know I can do so much more than just develop products but even with my current project, I don't go beyond doing basic dev work and tutorials.

My current company is also very large so it's easy to feel more like a "resource" than anything else. Through a startup, I'm hoping I'll be able to actually cultivate a more meaningful relationship with not just the work I'm doing but with my team.

## Describe what's your favorite website or app, and why.

Hopefully this doesn't come across as arrogant but I really love working with my personal website (fvcproductions.com).

Most developers find it difficult to maintain all the activity they get involved with in one centralized place like the personal portfolio/website but for me, it's basically addicting and I actually de-stress from working on it.

Since 2013, I've been happily blogging and sharing projects I've worked on through my personal website.

It's how I got my first freelance gig and the opportunity to mentor folks remotely.

Constantly updating and tweaking my website also allows me to tinker with and implement the latest and greatest trends in web like service workers, web push notifications and offline caching (PWAs).

For example, I recently migrated my personal website from the Wordpress CMS to using a static site generator through Hugo and Netlify for hosting/deployments. That process was alone was exhausting but I learned so much and will never look back to traditional CMS again!

## What's the thing you've accomplished and you're the most proud of?

Since having graduated with an MS in CS from Cornell Tech, I've taken a total of 89 college-level courses starting from 2010. To provide context, that's about 30% more than the average master's student will take, including undergrad courses.

For undergrad, I was awarded a full-ride merit scholarship and graduated as the valedictorian of the CS department in just 2.5 years at the age of 20.

It's extremely rare to find someone of my background (Latina) who enjoys going to hackathons and conferences so much. Since 2011, I've attended over 40 different tech events with plans to attend 6 more within the first 3 months of 2018.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

So the Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations. And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Latinas and Black women holding only 1% and 3% of computing jobs, respectively.

So what can one conclude from all this?

Well, first, let me provide some context.

A unicorn, as I'm sure you already know, is a startup company valued at over $1 billion. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about 1.28% likely to happen).

This means that according to those standards, I'm quite literally a "unicorn" in the sense that I'm part of the 1% of Latinas that considers herself a die-hard software engineer.

Now I became aware of this isolation so long ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who want to enter the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in.

So with all that being said, I will not settle for a company where it's obvious the team is terribly homogenous in background and I'm not interested in being the only female dev on a team. If you're able to make Algolia work with a small team of young privileged males, kudos to you but that environment would NOT bode well for me.
