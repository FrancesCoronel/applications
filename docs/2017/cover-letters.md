## Software Engineer

### Full-Time

Dear [Company],

This letter is to express my interest in your posting for your software engineer role. I’m currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell Tech in New York City, having received a BS in CS prior.

I’m interested in [DoSomething] because [I’ve always been in a bigger believer in actions than words]. It’s why I’ve taken the initiative to pursue a Master’s by the age of 21 so I can really start going out and changing the world in my own unique way.

With my past projects, I have received very good feedback on my work done using Sketch and Keynote for rapid prototyping and presentation designs. My background includes internships involving web design and development using HTML/CSS/JS as well as optimizing the UI for Unity applications.

Through this internship, I hope to gain a lot more experience in software engineering. I first started my journey into the world of digital hieroglyphics my junior year of high school and don’t intend to leave the tech scene anytime soon.

Feel free to refer to my GitHub or portfolio for more examples of my developer work.

I look forward to hearing back!

Cheers,
Frances

### Intern

Dear [Company],

This letter is to express my interest in your posting for the software engineering intern role. I’m currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at Cornell Tech in New York City, having received a Bachelor’s in Computer Science prior.

With my past projects, I have received very good feedback on my work done using Sketch and Keynote for rapid prototyping and presentation designs. My background includes internships involving web design and development using HTML/CSS/JS as well as optimizing the UI for Unity applications.

Through this internship, I hope to gain a start in a PM career. Since I have experience with design and development already, I took the initiative this past fall by attending a part-time product management course in New York City through Product School. At 20, I was one of the youngest students they have ever accepted but given my experience, they decided to admit me. I have since graduated and gone on to read "Cracking the PM Interview" on my own. Ideally, this internship would lead to a full-time position at [INSERT COMPANY NAME HERE] afterward.

I’m hoping to learn what it is like to work at a startup in Silicon Alley instead of the Valley and absorb as much technical aptitude as I can from whichever company I’m lucky enough to get paired up with.

The idea of participating in a project that involves social impact around diversity in tech is also ridiculously intriguing to me because I’ve dedicated a lot of time to the effort through many different avenues (mentoring potential bootcamp students, freelancing for/speaking at/attending conferences that promote diversity).

Feel free to refer to my GitHub or portfolio for more examples of my developer work.

I look forward to hearing back!

Cheers,
Frances

## Product Design

I was introduced via a16z to the software engineering position for Everlaw but as of right now, I’m looking for roles that focus more on design than just purely development since that intersection aligns more with my future career path. This position seems more of a fit.

I have received very good feedback on my work done with Sketch and Keynote for rapid prototyping and presentation designs. My background includes internships primarily involving product design and development using HTML/CSS/JS or Unity.

While I have no formal design education, I've given a talk on web design several times at tech events and have taken an online course in web design through Designlab.

I would encourage you to view some of this work on my Speaker Deck at http://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions or through my portfolio at http://fvcproductions.com/portfolio.
