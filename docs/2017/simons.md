# Mr. and Mrs. Simons

I am writing to express my deepest gratitude to you both for making the Simons scholarship possible. I was very happy to learn of my selection for your scholarship and my parents were thrilled when I told them the news (knowing their financial burden wouldn't be as hefty).

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Cornell Tech right now, having received a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Hampton University prior. I consider myself a developer with a design background and I tend to get a lot of personal satisfaction out of helping the local tech community through my varied skill set. Upon graduating from Cornell Tech, I aspire to find a role that is able to combine both my design and development skills at a cutting edge tech company.

At this point, I've set my heart and soul to pursuing a career in the startup tech scene just because every time I learn something new within the field, I feel like a child again (it's a wonderful feeling). The constant change I'll have to go through also resonates well with me since I don't like to focus on the same thing for too long and I'll never be able to claim I'm an expert for too long.

Then some days I feel silly for wanting to pursue a field with such ambition given that my family and relatives alike come from such humble backgrounds. When you're a first generation Hispanic female interested in coding, it raises some eyebrows at family gatherings. Not because it's such a terrible idea, but because it's just generally unexpected that people like me will ever stay long in this kind of field. Damned lies and statistics, indeed.

To mitigate this fear, I have to reassure myself constantly whenever I'm dealing with something difficult academically or technically that the mastery of any field requires a grand amount of time, passion, and dedication. I try instead to view my academic struggles as small obstacles I have to either overcome or diverge from by finding a sub-field within that struggle more suited to my skill-set.

For example, I've come to understand that I'm not terribly great at math, but when it comes to coding, I enjoy it because you're taking the algorithms already built by someone else and combining/tweaking them to form your own high-level product. So when it comes to math, I focus more on how I can leverage the algorithms of others to create my own special derivative. If this sounds unorthodox to you, you're probably not much of a programmer (no offense).

In other words, if I don't feel like I'm on the path to contributing to society in some sort of meaningful way, I start feeling extremely desolate and just scared. What legacy do I want to leave behind?

The reason I'm at Cornell Tech now is because I'm not ready to stop learning (to put it simply). While attending a coding bootcamp in NYC this past summer, I met this wonderful young lady who is studying for her Master's in Connective Media. She and I ended up working together for our final capstone project during the bootcamp.

We had many conversations about how Cornell Tech had proven to her many times over that our current education system can be improved with the right curriculum and group of people. She loved her program and hearing her stories inspired me to apply to the MEng in CS. Ideally, with the skills I'll learn through the program, I too will be able to inspire others in the tech scene and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.

Thanks to your scholarship, you have brought me one step closer to my life-long goals. I intend on working hard to complete this degree by next May and eventually getting to the position where I can give something as big back to the community or to future students like myself.

**Cheers,
