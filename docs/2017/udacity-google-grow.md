Well, as a budding software engineer focused on UI development, Google's Udacity courses directly addresses the tools and topics I want to develop my skills in. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skill set whenever necessary. It's what I love most about the work I do - the constant change of it all and how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time. I want to be able to explore how I can make my web apps both in my workplace and through my open-source contributions more progressive through offline and mobile-friendly capabilities. I believe such a feat would really set on my right path to a great start to what I hope will be a long career in the tech industry.

The Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations. And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Latinas and Black women holding only 1% and 3% of computing jobs, respectively.

So what can I conclude from all this?

Well, first, let me provide some context.

A unicorn is a startup company valued at over $1 billion. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about 1.28% likely to happen).

This means that according to those standards, I'm quite literally a "unicorn" in the sense that I'm part of the 1% of Latinas that considers herself a die-hard software engineer.

Now I became aware of this isolation so long ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who want to enter the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in.

With this course, I'm hoping to not only learn the latest and greatest in web development standards but ultimately, my goal lies in becoming a leader in the field in other to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.
