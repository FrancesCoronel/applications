## Tell us about a time you built something awesome in code. How did you choose it? Why did you enjoy it?

### Long Version

Every fall, leading startups, companies, and organizations in NYC pose business challenges to Cornell Tech, which is where I happen to be getting my Master’s in CS right now. Teams are then tasked to develop and present new products, services, and strategies that respond to those challenges.

My team of 3 ladies (including myself) recently finished responding to The New York Times (Community) challenge which was as follows: “How might we create a safe place for people of all backgrounds to discuss important local, national, and global issues?”

My team interpreted being able to solve this challenge by creating a feature that would invite more folks of different backgrounds to participate in news discussion. Ultimately, we ended up creating the Q&A platform which directly solicited the opinions of readers by asking questions based off of article text analysis and user reading history.

Ultimately, the reason it's one my favorite project thus far and why I also feel it is a time where I felt I was building something awesome in code is because all three of us had recognized how important being able to increase the diversity of the user base for the New York Times was. And it’s not just because all of us came from underrepresented backgrounds in tech that we recognized this but because diversity is important for engagement, collaboration, monetization, and the overall community standards of the New York Times. Since I could relate to my team members better, I wasn't afraid of brainstorming any idea, regardless of how ludicrous.

### Short Version

I recently collaborated with the New York Times through Cornell Tech with a team of 3 ladies (including myself). We were tasked with creating a feature that would invite more folks of different backgrounds to participate in news discussion. My team ended up tackling this by creating the Q&A platform which directly solicited the opinions of readers by asking questions based off of article text analysis and user reading history. Ultimately, the reason it's my favorite project thus far is because we had all recognized how important being able to increase diversity of the user base was just from our personal backgrounds and because I could relate to my team members better, I wasn't afraid of brainstorming any idea, regardless of how ludicrous.

## Is there a particular technology or industry you're currently interested in? How come? Where do you see it heading in the future?

Yes, I think coding bootcamps are going to be seen as a viable way of getting a job in the tech industry versus the standard getting a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from a university.

Programs like Coursera and Udacity have already provided a lot of free premier educational resources for those who cannot afford a traditional degree and I find them quite beneficial but the completion rates for online courses can’t be ignored and I’ve experienced personally how difficult it can be to become disciplined enough to learn on your own unless it is highly interactive. I believe it is part of the reason coding bootcamps are doing so well financially since they’re able to charge for that in-person classroom like setting. I don’t like saying the word classroom because it has such a negative connotation in my mindset but regardless, a lot of folks see coding bootcamps as the more viable option in terms of time, commitment, and money. And a lot of the time, it is.

So all in all, I believe coding bootcamps in the future will either find themselves being incorporated into the CS curriculum by top schools who can afford it (which is already happening) or transforming into another trusted avenue of getting a job in the tech industry.

## Name some of your favorite projects.

### Product Studio - NYTimes

Every fall, leading startups, companies, and organizations in NYC pose business challenges to Cornell Tech. In Product Studio, teams develop and present new products, services, and strategies that respond to those challenges. My team responded to The New York Times Community challenge: How might we create a safe place for people of all backgrounds to discuss important local, national, and global issues?

To address this problem, we created Q&A, a platform that solicits the opinion of readers based off of both the text analysis of an article and their personal reading history. Feel free to view the final result here: "https://fvcproductions.com/portfolio/product-studio-final-sprint/".

This is a project I'm especially proud of because I was able to have a lot of decision control over the end product as the lead developer and designer on the team. I also felt I could actually relate to my product since it was trying to solve the issue of diversifying communities, which is something I personally struggle with myself.

### Jeopardy Template

> https://fvcproductions.com/portfolio/jeopardy-template/

My mom is a Spanish high school teacher and she was frustrated trying to create a Jeopardy template using PPT. I told her I would make her one and as a result I created a version for not just Google Slides (which is much nicer than PPT in my opinion) but also a version for Keynote. I published it last year and so far it’s gotten almost 20K hits across the web just based off my Behance, Speaker Deck, and bit.ly link stats I made for them. Over 200 people have reached out via Google Slides attempting to get edit access (I have the emails to prove this). It got to the point where I had to set up an automatic reply for anyone trying to do this in order to show them how to make a copy that they could edit themselves on Google Slides.

### Alienware Desktop

> https://www.behance.net/gallery/17207493/Alienware-Desktop

This is a customization I made for my Mac two years ago back when it was easier to customize such things. Even though I’ve never used an Alienware computer, I think their design is really cool so I based it off that. I chose this project not because its technically challenging but because the concept of customization in general is very appealing to me and I apply to a lot of aspects in my life. In other words, I have always have believed customized, tailored solutions are much cooler and what I generally find more enjoyable in whatever environment I’m working in.

### MapMe Coding Bootcamps

> https://fvcproductions.com/portfolio/mapme-coding-bootcamps/

I don't know if this would necessarily be deemed technical but I did help create a map of all the coding bootcamps out there because I didn't see any existing solution in place. I myself have attended It's gotten over 16K hits on Google Maps alone but I recently created a crowd-sourced version as well. Either way, both of these are the two top results on Google for the search query "map of coding bootcamps".

## When you're not coding, what do you like to do?

Attend Meetups, obsess over the latest and greatest productivity/coding tools (via Product Hunt mostly), question Quora, watch John Oliver on YouTube, discover a song on Spotify and repeat it over and over till I get sick of it, blog/write/read, attend/speak at/freelance at tech conferences, watch movies in an actual theater (vintage, I know), micro-manage my online presence, mentor cool people, and cuddle with my boyfriend. Publishing stuff online.

## What impact do you want to have on the world and why (500 words)?

“I know that I know nothing.” -The Socratic Paradox

At this point, I've set my heart and soul to pursuing a career in the tech industry just because every time I learn something new within the field, I feel like a child again (it's a wonderful feeling). The constant change I'll have to go through also resonates well with me since I don't like to focus on the same thing for too long and I'll never be able to claim I'm an expert for too long.

Then some days I feel silly for wanting to pursue a field with such ambition given that my family and relatives alike come from such humble backgrounds. When you're a first generation Hispanic female interested in coding, it raises some eyebrows at family gatherings. Not because it's such a terrible idea, but because it's just generally unexpected that people like me will ever stay long in this kind of field.

My prior academic history will tell you I've always tried to pursue typical life events at an earlier age and am constantly trying to involve myself with the non-familiar. I entered primary school earlier, took numerous college classes through dual enrollment all throughout high school starting at the age of 13, graduated high school at the top of my class, graduated with from college as valedictorian for the computer science department and now intend to receive my master's by the age of 21. For me, it's never been the rush, but the thrill of the experiences I've gone through that have compelled me to be crazy enough to seek them out time and time again.

I am one of the few Latinas I know studying computer science (usually the only one in my past experiences) and because I realized the severity of my isolation so long ago, I've had a strong desire from the beginning to inspire those who want to come into the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in. Ultimately, the impact I want to have on the world lies in becoming a leader in the tech industry in order to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.

## When did you first get interested in learning to code? Why?

I was actually initially interested in bio-informatics most of my high school career. My junior year of high school, however, I figured why don’t I just major in computer science? It’s the other half of bio-informatics that I have little to no experience in. And once I finished my degree in CS, I could still do on to work in bio-informatics. It was a win, win! In the end, I got a lot more vested in the CS aspect and I haven't looked back since!

## What are the classes in computer science you've taken so far?

My first formal CS class covered the fundamentals of C++ in summer 2013 at a local community college.

Later, I decided to study CS abroad for a semester in Germany and took formal courses in Python and Java.

I transferred to Hampton University to continue my studies in CS afterward and started taking more programming courses, becoming formally exposed to C, C++, Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, and Android development with Java.

I attended Fullstack Academy in the summer of 2015 and was taught the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js).

After Fullstack Academy, I started working professionally as a developer.

## In your past roles, what technologies did you work with?

My first real job was at 80|20 Software Consulting, which I was able to get shortly after graduating from Fullstack. Even though most of the projects were client based, I ended up working on an internal platform using HTML/CSS/JS and AngularJS that targeted clients who couldn’t afford the regular cost of our services and would be okay with a more automated way of maintaining their website instead. Within that role, I also consulted a few folks on their Wordpress websites.

I only ended up working at 80|20 for a few months before realizing it was interfering too much with my schooling as I was finishing my last semester of undergrad and had to complete several research projects that I didn’t enjoy very much at all.

I ended up receiving a full-time offer to work at Accenture as a technical consultant in SF upon graduating from Hampton in May 2016 but I turned it down and went with an internship instead since I decided to myself that I needed to learn some more and get a Master’s in CS too. I was also younger than the average college grad (20) and I didn’t feel it was necessary to enter the workforce immediately.

At that internship, Accenture placed me in their Redwood City office which was pretty hip and “lean”. There, I was part of the very small wearables team where I worked on optimizing Unity applications to impress clients. I didn’t have any experience with Unity or consumer hardware before but I was surprised I learned as fast as I did.

The main tools/languages I used throughout my internship were Unity (C# and JS are used to create scripts), Sketch, Android Studio, Xcode, and Safari for Developers. I also helped the onboarding team create documentation in order to prepare incoming developers on the basics of Unity and all the hardware available.

Accenture offered me a full-time offer once again following the internship but alas, I turned it down already because I felt the company wasn't really for me.

In December 2016, I took on a role as ambassador for Fullstack Academy, the program I mentioned earlier. It is similar to being a dev evangelist but it doesn’t really require any technical acumen. Just a lot of passion for Fullstack and what it offers.

In May of 2017, I accepted a full-time position with Accenture as a Software Engineer at the Liquid Studio in Redwood City, CA.

I've recently supplemented my work by doing mentorship part-time through Thinkful since last month.

It’s pretty clear that my experience thus far has been mostly with larger corporations. I’m expecting this to change.

## Describe something you do for your community or the benefit of others. What inspires you to do this?

I mentor, freelance, and speak with organizations that promote diversity in tech.

Some recent examples of this are:

- acted as a graduate mentor for WiTNY (Women in Technology & Entrepreneurship in New York) through Cornell Tech
- freelance blogging for AlterConf which is a traveling conference promoting diversity in tech
- spoke at a Fullstack Academy alumni panel which is a coding bootcamp that helped created Grace Hopper Academy - one of the few all female coding bootcamps that doesn't charge any tuition up front

I am one of the few Latinas I know studying computer science (usually the only one in the room) and because I realized the severity of my isolation so long ago, I've had a strong desire from the beginning to inspire those who want to come into the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in. Ultimately, the impact I want to have on the world lies in becoming a leader in the tech industry in order to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.

https://fvcproductions.github.io/anagram

Anagram Checker that is Duolingo branded.

I tried to make this anagram checker as succint as possible and it does what it's supposed to do. Plus, I think it's cute.

## What are your long-term plans?

Front End Engineer or User Interface Developer who ends up transitioning to Product Management down the road.

Then ideally, I'll transition to a more senior level role like CTO, CEO, etc.

The reasons for pursuing the more ambitious route long-term relates to why I try to be so heavily involved in the tech community.

I merely want to show other people from my background that they can do these things too.

Since I happen to strongly believe in leading by example, this will hopefully lead to more Latinas in tech.

## Tell us about a challenging project that you worked on or a challenge in your life that you have overcome.

Never having anyone to relate to just based off more superficial things (race, gender, cultural background, etc.) can actually be really difficult sometimes.

Within the tech community, there are usually bubbles formed around people of certain backgrounds and for the most part, I tend to not fit into them being Latina.

When you're literally the only female minority or Latina in the room all the time, it starts to feel isolating and discouraging.

There are times when I get really tired of this and become depressed but I always manage to tell myself that this is a field I want to stay in and one I can be successful in as long as I keep at it.

## Anything else you would like to share?

I try to update my website as much as possible with my projects so feel free to explore that as much as you can to get a better idea of who I am as a person and not just a student or developer.

I'm active on a lot of different websites and for an idea of that, you're welcome to check out my Gravatar at http://gravatar.com/fvcproductions.
