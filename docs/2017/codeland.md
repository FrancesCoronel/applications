CodeNewbie aims to make this conference an accessible opportunity for everyone by providing financial support to attend. This support comes in the form of a conference ticket at the heavily discounted price of just $25, along with potential to cover travel expenses, depending on need and available funds. If you are part of an underrepresented group in tech, including women, members of underrepresented demographic groups*, and members of the LGBTQ community, we highly encourage you to apply.
For conference info, visit our website: codelandconf.com. For questions email hello@codenewbie.org.

* Underrepresented demographic groups include African Americans, Mexican-Americans, Native Americans (American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians), Hispanic and Latino Americans, Pacific Islanders, and mainland Puerto Ricans.

What’s your full name? *

What's your email address? *

hello@fvcproductions.com
How much programming experience do you have? It’s ok if you have none or are just getting started :) *

I've had a part-time gig as a front-end developer and a full-time summer internship as a wearables developer. I would say I have 3 years of solid dev experience.
Tell us about your current status. If you’re employed, what do you do? If you're unemployed, what are you currently up to? *

I'm getting my Master's in Computer Science at Cornell Tech right now.
Codeland aims to provide particular support to groups underrepresented in tech, including women, members of underrepresented demographic groups*, and members of the LGBTQ community. Which of these groups, if any, are you a member of?

I'm a Latina! :) So more specifically I'm female and 100% Peruvian-American.
What we can offer in scholarships will depend on need and availability. In order to attend the conference, what expenses would you need to have covered (ex: flight, hotel, childcare)? *

I'll be in NYC so no extra support necessary!
Community is very important to us. How have you been a supportive community member in your life (it can be code-related or outside of tech)? Please provide details. *

I've spoken at conferences that promote diversity in tech. I've personally mentored folks trying to get into coding bootcamps, which have been proven to be a key way for underrepresented folks to get into the tech industry. You're welcome to look more into this at http://fvcproductions.com/services.
Have you had any involvement in the CodeNewbie community thus far? If so, please describe that involvement. (ex: participated in the Twitter chats, helped people on our Slack) *

I've listened to a few podcasts and have joined the Meetup group.
What are your code-related goals/plans? How does attending Codeland fit into those? *

A lot of people ask me which company I want to work for later. To me, it's not who I'm working with but who I end up being myself to others. I want to be able to inspire others like me to enter into the tech industry. The best way to do that is to become someone of power in the tech industry. Ergo, that is my ultimate goal: to become the best I can be in an industry that constantly ignores my presence in order to inspire others who have felt the same way.
One of the goals of the scholarship is to select people who cannot otherwise afford to attend. Tell us why you need this scholarship. *

When you're a college student, every penny counts. Also, Cornell Tech is ridiculously expensive. Did I mention Cornell Tech is in NYC, a city famous for also being ridiculously expensive?
If you're on LinkedIn, what's the link to your profile? *
